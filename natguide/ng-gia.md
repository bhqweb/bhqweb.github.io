Global Interaction (formerly Australian Baptist Missionary Society), the overseas missionary arm of Australian Baptist Churches, started its service as a group of colonial Baptist Mission Societies from 1864.  Since the first Australian personnel went out in 1882, there has been a continuous supply of people and programmes.  The Colonial Societies federated in 1913 to become the Australian Baptist Foreign Mission.  Initially activities were focused on East Bengal, India (now Bangladesh) but diversification followed 1945.  As at 2012 Global Interaction has staff in 11 countries and direct link with six others.
