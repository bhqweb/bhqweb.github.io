**Artefacts**

The Baptist Union of WA does not have a museum.  Collection policy in regard to artefacts is to discourage forwarding them to the Archives.  Any currently held are regarded as being on a temporary basis pending proper provision for their preservation and storage.



**Finding Aids**

All accessioned material is recorded in a computer database.

Unaccessioned material is roughly sorted in labelled boxes organized in the three areas mentioned under ‘Holdings’ above.

  

**Facilities**

Storage facilities are modelled on those used at the State Archives.  Open Access shelving provides access to key resources.  The compactus shelving is locked, but items it contains may be made available by prior arrangement with the Archivist.  Any photocopying requires the Archivist’s permission and may only be undertaken by the Archivist or his/her representative.  Fragile materials may not be photocopied unless they have been encapsulated, and even then may have restrictions placed on them.  Where a transcript of fragile materials exists, this will normally be the form made available for photocopying.
