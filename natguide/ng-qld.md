The Baptist Church Archives Queensland is the central repository for the documentary and electronic historical records of the Baptist Union of Queensland, and its constituents.

 

**Functions**

1. To collect and store the historical records of the Baptist Union of Queensland, its departments, committees, divisions, charter groups and agencies, and where possible and necessary, those of its member churches
2. To conserve, preserve, classify and index these records as far as possible according to professional standards
3. To make the records readily available for bona fide resear­chers
4. To promote the value of historical records and to educate the Baptist constituency in their use

 

**Access**: during normal office hours, by appointment. Material is not on open access but must be handled by arrangement with the Archivist.

 

**Policies on access**: Records are generally available to bona fide researchers; access is at the discretion of the Archivist. Appointments are necessary and enquires should be made initially by email, preferably.  Most material is accessible, although restrictions apply to sensitive and  recent records, personal papers and to older fragile material. Written application must be made for use of material in commercial works. Due acknowledgment of all material used must be made in the form, “*Used with permission of Baptist Archives, Qld. (Date)*”

 

**Fees**: No set fees are levied except for commercial work and extensive searches, but donations towards the upkeep and development of the Archives are requested. Out of pocket expenses for postage, phone calls and photocopying  etc., will be charged.

 

**Indexing**: Most material has been broadly classified and is indexed on a computerised system. Computerised church membership figures and growth patterns are also available on request. Depending upon the amount and type of information needed, a dona­tion may be requested for access to this service.

 

**Holdings**: Most material is on paper but there is a growing volume of digital material as the Archives. Some, but not all, digital material is identified below. Enquiries welcome.
