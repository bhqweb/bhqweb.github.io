### In Australian Library and Archive Collections



This list includes Australian Baptist periodicals and newspapers, as well as many that are published overseas. Some articles related to Australian Baptists can also be found in these international publications. Holdings information for each of the state colleges, state/national libraries and archive/historical society collections in Australia has been provided for each title. Holdings information is listed alphabetically according to the area and library codes as detailed in the key below. Titles are arranged in alphabetical order by title, ignoring definite or indefinite articles, with the main title in bold and any sub-title in normal text. After the title follows the place of publication and responsible body (where these could be determined). Publication dates and ISSN have also been added where known as well as brief details related to any changes in title. Indication is also given as to whether each journal title is indexed by the Australasian Religion Index (ARI) or the ATLA Religion Database (ATLA). The Australian Baptist periodicals that are likely to be of most interest to researchers have been highlighted in blue. These are the most significant of the state or national denominational publications.
