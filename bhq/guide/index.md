_Most of the important places associated with early Baptist life are located close to
the central business district of Brisbane. So it is easy to visit them and to
remember that they serve as reminders of God's grace and the zeal of our
founders. Here is a suggested car tour of these sites requiring only a short
time to complete. It includes some optional extras for those with more time.
(Use your GPS for more assistance)_

A convenient place to start
is Alice Street, near the City Botanic Gardens. At the corner of George and
Alice Streets, diagonally opposite the Gardens, the first Baptist minister in
Brisbane **Rev. Charles Stewart** owned land
which later became the site of the famous Bellevue Hotel (demolished in
controversial circumstances in 1979). Drive along Alice Street and turn right
just before the river into William St. As you pass the Commissariat Stores,
look to right and notice Stephens Lane, named after **Thomas B. Stephens**, a prominent early Baptist who operated a
leather business here. At the other end of the lane, on the corner of Charlotte
Street, stood the _Moreton Bay Courier_
office owned by another leading Baptist, **James Swan.**

On the left hand side of
the lane stands the old Land Administration Building, now the Treasury Hotel.
This is the location of the **United
Evangelical Church**, which was erected in April 1851 (the plaque was
unveiled exactly 150 years later!) as the place of worship for Baptist,
Presbyterian and Congregational migrants who settled in Moreton Bay colony
under a scheme organised by** Rev. Dr John
Dunmore Lang, **with Charles Stewart as minister. They arrived in 1849 on the
ships _Fortitude_, _Chaseley_ and _Lima_ and
formed the church immediately under the leadership of the pastor, Rev. Charles
Stewart; he served until the end of 1854. The building was sold in 1857 and
later used as the Electric Telegraph Office; it was demolished in 1899 to make
way for the Land Administration Building, also used as the Executive Building
and now a Hotel.

Turn right into Elizabeth Street, and as
you drive along beyond George Street (if you want to park, walk over to the Queen
Street Mall) note that one block over to the left in Queen St., on the far side
of the present mall stood the old **Prisoners'
Barracks**, which later were used for the Court House. Here the united
services and also the** first Baptist
services** were held. The first Baptist fellowship commenced in early 1855,
led by Rev. Charles Smith, formerly of Parramatta, NSW. 

Proceed
down Elizabeth Street as far as the intersection with Eagle Street. On the far
side of the big fig tree in the middle of the street at 69 Eagle Street
(currently Riparian Plaza) stood a building that housed the Baptist Union
offices 1973-82. Turn left up Wharf Street notice the corner of Adelaide Street
(StudentOne) (Queen Street side) where the first Baptist chapel in Brisbane,
known as **Wharf Street Baptist Church,**
used to stand. It was erected in 1859 by the builder, John Petrie, for £2050. The
block of ground, which seemed almost too far from the town in those days, was
sold to the church for £100 by T.B. Stephens, a foundation member and later
also the owner of the _Moreton Bay Courier_
and successful politician. Rev. Benjamin G. Wilson, who had commenced his
vigorous ministry in 1858, served until ill health caused his retirement and
death in 1878. He established many outstations and encouraged the formation of
churches in other areas like Ipswich and Maryborough. The chapel was extended
and used until 1890, when it was sold for £165 and the site for £16,000.

Go
one more block and turn left into Ann Street and just around the corner, notice
345, opposite All Saints' Church - the site of the first permanent **Baptist Union headquarters,** 1960 to 1972.
Continue along Ann Street past the front of the Central Railway Station. A
church which broke away from Wharf Street was located in **Edward Street** where the Mincom Building stands, from 1866-68 (although
the building itself remained there much longer). 

Continue
to George Street, and then turn right and then right again into Turbot Street.
As you cross the overpass past the court building, look down to the left on
Roma Street where the** first baptisms**
took place on 31 May 1857 in the stream running from town reservoir. They were
conducted by **Rev. James Voller**, then
of Bathurst Street church in Sydney, who was visiting Brisbane to assist the
church after its first minister had left. The candidates were two young men,
James and George Grimes, members of a prominent Baptist family.

Turn
left into Edward Street and crossing Wickham Terrace notice the **City Tabernacle Baptist Church**, listed
with the National Trust. This imposing building, designed by the important Baptist
architect and member of the church, Richard Gailey, was erected in 1890 at a
total cost of £20,799, to replace the old Wharf Street building. The pastor was
**Rev. William Whale** (1885-1903), a
graduate of Spurgeon's Pastors’ College, London and the most outstanding
churchman in Brisbane at the time. The church was a landmark for Brisbane until
high-rise buildings began to obscure it. 

For one hundred and thirty years it has
served the needs of a large city congregation. But for most of that time, it
was also the hub of Baptist denominational life as well. For many years, it was
the site of the annual Assemblies and many other Baptist Union functions. Its
striking tower was the birthplace of the Baptist Theological College and its
home for a lengthy period. The Ministers' Fraternal also used it for its
meetings. A ‘time capsule’ hidden in the base at the time of erection contains
interesting documentation of life in the 1890s (but its exact whereabouts in
the structure are unknown). The plaque on the right of the front doors also records
the close connection between the church and the **Christian Endeavour** movement. Near the Upper Edward Street door,
see a commemoration of a school conducted on the premises which became Sommerville
House, and at the back of building, note Willara House which was the original
manse. 

Proceed
along Upper Edward Street and Leichhardt Street into Fortescue Street. On the
right, near the corner stood the **Fortescue
Street **church (a continuation of the Edward Street church) from 1876
(another Richard Gailey building). The fellowship disbanded in 1889 and the
building was moved to Chapel Street, Nundah where it was used by the Baptist
Church there; it has been used in by various groups, including a church for
some time). Follow Fortescue Street across Boundary Street and to Gregory
Terrace. The minister of Wharf Street church, **Rev. Benjamin G. Wilson**, lived in this fashionable area just to the
right of the junction. 

Follow
Gregory Terrace to the left right through to College Road, go through the
Five-Ways and turn left into Hale Street, observing the old** Petrie Terrace Church** on the left, opposite Lang Park, now in
private hands and converted into an attractive residential building. The
fellowship was established in 1870 as an outreach from the Edward Street
church, consolidating Sunday School and Band of Hope work commenced earlier.
The ground was given by pioneer Baptist and first pastor, **Rev. W. Moore.  **The first building
was erected in 1869 and this one in 1895. Lang Park (named after the famous
Presbyterian minister whose work assisted Baptists in Queensland as well as
many other groups, Rev Dr John Dunmore Lang, for many years now the site of a
major sporting stadium, was the site of the Brisbane Burial grounds, the Paddington
Cemeteries, from 1844 to 1865. The Baptist section was located near Moreton and
Charlotte Streets, north of Caxton Street.

**For a short extension of this tour**, go
to Milton Road and follow it through to Croydon Street. At the intersection of
Jephson Street and Sylvan Road, notice **Toowong
Baptist Church**, the home of a Chinese congregation. The main part of this
building was erected in 1881 (and enlarged in 1884 and vestries added) by the
long-time founder-pastor, William Richer, making it the oldest existing church
building still in use by a Baptist church. Richer was responsible for many other
buildings including Albion and Petrie Terrace Baptist Churches. Retrace your
route to Milton Road and turning to the left, follow it to the **Toowong Cemetery** (established in 1875
to replace the old Paddington Cemeteries). Here such people as Revs. B.G.
Wilson, J. Kingsford (Jireh), W. Whale, James Voller and first missionary, Miss
Martha Plested were buried.

If
you have more time, continue along the Western Freeway and turn left onto
Moggill Road. **Rev. William Moore**
lived on the present site of the Indooroopilly State School in his retirement,
giving time to the establishment of the school. He is buried in the Chapel Hill
Uniting cemetery on Moggill Road. (The district of Moore Park – and the Baptist
church adjacent of the same name – was probably named after his son.) Drive out
through Kenmore to Gold Creek Road and see **Brookfield Baptist aged care centre**, opened 1972, and beyond that the Queensland Camps
and Convention Centre’s latest site, the former **Queensland Baptist College of Ministries **(the college was relocated
from Gray Road, West End and opened in 1974; it moved to Prospect Road Gaythorne
in 2005 and renamed Malyon Theological College). These facilities are on land originally selected by Dr J.L. Dart
in recognition of the contribution made by the **Dart family** to the Brookfield area and Baptist witness in
Queensland. Several family members are buried in the local cemetery.

Return
back to the city by Milton Road or Coronation Drive and crossing William Jolly
Bridge drive along Grey Street, South Brisbane. As you cross the bridge, look
forward to the left towards the Library and Museum – Rev. Charles Stewart
resided in this area for some time. Further down Grey Street beyond Melbourne
Street lies the South Brisbane Railway Station. The main building stands on the
site of a Presbyterian Church where **Rev.
John Kingsford**, founding pastor of the Jireh Church, had earlier exercised
a valuable preaching ministry. 

Turn
right into Peel Street and right again into Merivale St, and taking a left
turn, enter Montague Road, following it to Gray Road, Hill End. Observing at
Number 55 the first residential home of the**
Baptist Theological College** in a building given by Mr and Mrs E. Humphrey
in 1939. Additional buildings were erected and the site used until 1973 when
the move was made to the Brookfield site. The Yumba Hostel now occupies the Gray
Road site. 

Return
along Montague Road to Vulture Street, and travel through West End to the
junction with Stephens Road, noticing **Sommerville
House** ahead on the right. The boarding section of this school was the
family home of** T.B. Stephens**,
benefactor of the Wharf Street church. The school had its origins at the City
Tabernacle Baptist Church, Upper Edward Street. Stephens was also active in local
government representing South Brisbane and was mayor of Brisbane. Continue
along Vulture Street and at city side of Christie Lane, note the former site of
**South Brisbane Church**. This church
was founded in 1872 on land bought by T.B. Stephens, and became an influential
force on the south side of the city. It was not one of the original members of
the Baptist Union formed in 1877, but joined very soon after. Two of its
pastors, **Rev. William Bell **(1921-40)
and** Rev. Thos. C. Warriner **(1941-66),
served as principals of the College. In 2013 it 
relocated to 859 Stanley Street as Church@TheGabba. 

Continue
along Vulture Street, turning left at Main Street, cross the Story Bridge and
come to Gipps Street, Fortitude Valley. The former **Jireh Baptist Church** stood on the right in the area between the two
parts of the backpackers property marked ‘Swim’. It was formed as a Particular
Baptist Church with members from Wharf Street in 1861, and in turn fostered
numerous churches, including Windsor Road (1876), Albion (1882) and Nundah
(1886) – which in turn formed several other daughter churches. The building was
erected in 1862, being designed by the eminent local architect, Benjamin
Backhouse. It was classified by the National Trust in 1970. The fellowship
ceased operation in 1978, and its name was transferred to the Centenary Jireh church
at Middle Park. The old building was destroyed by fire in 1987 although it was
not in use as a church at the time. 

Unless
you decide to take the supplement mentioned next, this brief tour can end by
travelling back to the Queen Street mall, near where United Evangelical and
then Baptist services were first held; as you sip your coffee, remember also
that the** Kingsford Drapery** stood
near the site of Queens Plaza. R.A. Kingsford was a foundation member of Wharf
Street, and an interim lay pastor. He was also later a mayor of Brisbane and a
member of Parliament. His brother John was the first pastor of Jireh and served
in that position for 37 years.  

**However, for an interesting extension to
this tour**, proceed to Boundary Street and turn right along Gregory Terrace.
Looking down to the left overlooking the Inner City Bypass, notice that it was
along this hollow that****the first of** Lang's immigrants** were forced to set
up their camp in 1849 when the government refused to provide them with the
anticipated assistance. Continue on Gregory Terrace and find your way to Sandgate
Road and Toombul Shopping Town. Go through to the back and drive along Walker's
Way to Hedley Avenue. This is the ‘Zion's Hill’ area where the** Gossner Missionaries** from Germany
settled in 1838. Even before the colony was opened to free settlement, they
were beginning their work among the local aborigines. Their Christian
connections are reflected in names like Zion's Hill and near-by Kedron Brook
named by them in honour of biblical places. When the missionary work failed,
these pioneers turned to other pursuits, and associated themselves actively
with various churches, including the Baptist. Several are buried in the Nundah
Historical Cemetery on Hedley Avenue.

Return
to Sandgate Road and heading out of town, take the fork through ‘Nundah
Village’ and in the shopping area, turn left at Chapel Street (one way). Stop
by the park and observe the old Fortescue Street church next to the new North-East
Baptist Church, opened in 2003 to replace the Nundah War Memorial Church
(erected 1923). Follow around the front of the church into Bage Street and then
turn right down Boyd Street to turn left back into Sandgate Road. Turn left at
the roundabout at the end of the shops into a parking area and observe in the
park a dignified granite** memorial to the
first free settlers** from Zion’s Hill area, listing their names, some of
which are commemorated in local street names like Rode Road, Gerler Road and
Franz Road. 

Follow Sandgate Road
through to Virginia and turn left into Zillmere Road, noticing the watercourse
in this area – **Zillman’s Waterholes**. This is an area where many German
families settled and formed a church on the site of the Church of Christ, further
along Zillmere Road. Many of them moved from here to the fertile areas out
beyond Ipswich to take up farming in the Rosewood, Mt Walker and Fassifern
areas where they established thriving churches, some of which are still in
existence. 

Return
to Sandgate Road, and on the return journey, detour to the left from Sandgate
Road at Railway Parade to Alexandra Road and the **Clayfield Baptist Church, **originally known as Hendra Baptist
Church. The chapel which had been used at Zion's Hill since 1855 was re-erected
at the back of this property in about 1874 and remained in use until 1966, when
the present church was erected as a Christian Education block. Another
attractive church building had been used as the church from 1890 to 1986.  The site itself had been donated by one of
the Gossner missionaries, F.T. Franz, for this purpose. Further along at 61-63
Alexandra Road used to stand **Clifford
House**, the Baptist Aged Persons' Home, now sold and refurbished. This work
commenced at the stately **Farrington
House** in David Street, Alderley in 1949 which was used until its sale in
1956 and the move to more suitable premises at Ascot. New premises in Jimbour
St, Wooloowin were opened in 1991.

Return
to Sandgate Road and take the Albion Railway overpass; turn into McLennan
Street and see the **Albion Baptist Church**.
This church was established as an outreach of Jireh in the early 1880s; the
building was erected in 1883 and in 1890, Rev. William Higlett began a long and
effective ministry. He was a highly prominent and capable minister who served
prominently in both Queensland and later NSW. Across the Brisbane River, Jireh
church was also involved with the Bulimba Church, which was on land given by
the Johnson family, who had been Lang immigrants on the _Lima_.

As
you travel back to the city, pause to thank God for ‘the great cloud of witness’
who have laboured before us, and dedicate yourself again to follow ‘Jesus the
pioneer and perfecter of our faith’ in our own day. (Hebrews 12:1, 2)
