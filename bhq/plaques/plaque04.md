## No 4 2017 City Tabernacle Baptist Church

The second Baptist Heritage Plaque was officially opened at
the City Tabernacle Baptist Church on Sunday May 14. This plaque identifies the
building which was opened on 9 October 1890 as one of the significant churches
in the Brisbane CBD. It was designed to be an impressive ‘cathedral’ type
structure by the celebrated architect, Richard Gailey, who was a member of the
church and also designed several other Baptist churches. The plaque was
unveiled after the morning service by the President of Baptist Heritage
Queensland, Mr Eric Kopittke and the pastor of the church, Rev Richard Kingham.

This was the second building (and site) to be occupied by
this church, the previous building being located at the corner of Wharf and
Adelaide Streets in the city but it had become too
small for the church’s needs. The new structure was said at the time of opening
to be a ‘sacred edifice [which] occupies a commanding position and is certainly
one of the finest buildings of its kind in the colony, both as regards exterior
appearance and internal arrangements.’ 

The opening of the plaque took place exactly 160 years to
the day since Rev James Voller came from Sydney to assist the young ‘Brisbane
Baptist Church’ after it was facing closure due to the sudden departure of its
pastor. Voller encouraged the people to continue on, and to send to England for
a pastor. He also conducted the first baptisms in Brisbane in a reservoir in
Roma Street. Sometime later, Rev B G Wilson came from England and saw great
development in Baptist work.
