## No 2 2004 Vernor German Baptist Church

The second plaque was erected in 2004 on Old Fernvale Road,
Vernor, west of the Vernor Baptist Cemetery, to mark the site of the Vernor
Baptist Church. This plaque was placed in 2004 thanks to the efforts of Mr R A
(Dick) Scanlan, OAM of Laidley, and Rev John Lane (then of Wondai Baptist
Church)

The fellowship which used the building was first known as
'Brisbane River' Baptist Church, and was formed by German settlers who had moved
into the area in the 1860s. The first leader was Johannes Friedrich Heinrich
Faulkenhagen, formerly a member of Templin Baptist Church, north-east of Berlin,
Germany. He had been leader of a group of Germans associated with Wharf Street
Baptist Church. Some of the families had lived in the Nundah and Zillmere areas
before moving west. Although mostly lay-led, the church had a notable early
pastor in the person of Rev Hermann Windolf. 

A cemetery was established higher up along Fernvale Road,
which was later supplemented by another at Mount Tarampa (which is still in
use).  

The first location of the ‘Brisbane River’ church was close
to the banks of the river, but it was destroyed by floods. The building on Old
Fernvale Road was in use for many years and it was supplemented by another
chapel south of Lowood to serve the needs of the members in that area more
conveniently. Eventually, the Lowood chapel became the main centre. Another
relocation took place in 1926 to the Minden-Tarampa Road (then the fellowship
became known as the Tarampa Baptist Church). After about 70 years, numbers began
to decline and the church was disbanded in 1995. The building was taken over by
a Lutheran fellowship.
