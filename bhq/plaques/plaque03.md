## No 3 2016 Toowong Baptist Church

The first plaque in the new project was opened on 3 July 2016 at the Toowong
Baptist Church, 5 Jephson Street, Toowong, on the occasion of their 135th
anniversary celebrations. 

This building was opened on 4 September 1881 with seating for 100 people at a cost of
£250 ($500). The architect and builder was Mr William Richer who was also
pastor and founder of the church. It is the oldest Baptist church building
still in use as a church (the former Ipswich Baptist Church is older but no
longer in use). The main part was enlarged and vestries added in 1884, doubling
its size. It is recognised as a modest example of a timber framed church in the
Federation Carpenter Gothic style, and these beautiful features are on view
inside the main sanctuary. 

At
the time the church had a flourishing ministry especially amongst Chinese
speaking people which had then been in place for about 40 years and which continues
strongly to the present.
