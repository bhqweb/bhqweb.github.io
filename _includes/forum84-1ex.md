## BHQ Essay Prize Winners for 2012

Every time Malyon College runs its course on Baptist History and Principles, we offer a prize for the best essay. Dr David Parker usually teaches part of the course, and we are involved in setting the essay topic.

The course was taught last in August 2012 and we have pleasure in announcing that this time there were two equal winners. Both top essays were judged by members of the BHQ panel to be of such a quality that it was best to award a joint prize. Each recipient received copies of our latest books, Something more than Gold, and Pressing on with the Gospel, a year’s membership in BHQ and a cash prize (the total amount for the prize was raised by 50% and divided equally).

The prizes went to Matt Littlefield, Youth Pastor at Beenleigh and District Baptist Church, and Tim Lucas of Gateway Baptist Church. Matt’s prize was presented by the chair of BHQ at our meeting on 23 Feb (see picture above), while Tim’s was presented later at Gateway Church (left—centre, with Pastor Jason Elsmore and right, Anne Klose, the recipient of the last prize).

The essay topic required students to discuss a statement made by a NZ Baptist leader who claimed that contemporary Baptists are influenced too much by ideas dating to the earliest days of Baptist life stemming from the earlier Anabaptists rather than the Bible. He claims that because of this there is too much emphasis on the independence of the local church at the expense of interdependency. This claim also had to be discussed in relation to the situation in Queensland.

Abbreviated versions of their essays are printed in this issue (without full references or bibliography) - (enquire about paper copies). For more details contact the prize-winners direct.
