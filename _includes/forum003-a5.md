## Windsor Road

On Monday, June 17th, Brian Robertson, associate pastor of
Windsor Road church addressed the BHSQ meeting on the history of the
church. He had also prepared an impressive display of photographs,
plans, books and other objects relating to the life of the church.
These even included a fence panel and a century-old banner. He was
ably assisted in the meeting by one of the older adherents of the
church, Mr Spiers, who had lived in the area since the 19205. His
descriptions of the church and the surrounding districts added a
dynamic touch to the presentation, making the meeting one of the most
interesting yet.

*Here is an abbreviated account Pastor Robertson's talk.*

The beginnings of the church took place when Rev. John
Kingsford, pastor of Jireh Church in the, Valley, and Rev., John
Straughen, an evangelist, conducted open-air meetings in the expanding
suburb of Red Hill in the early 1870s. A Sunday School was commenced
and cottage prayer meetings were initiated. On May 24, 1874 a small
building known as Ebenezer Chapel was opened on what is now called
Waterworks road, where the small Baptist congregation gathered for
worship.

On June 5, 1877, the church was officially constituted with
19 members and with Rev. Thomas Leitch as the first pastor. The young
church continued to meet in the Ebenezer Chapel until growth caused a
pressing need for a larger meeting place. A new site was purchased on
Windsor Road (the present site), and a new building was constructed
there in 1888 for a cost of 2000 pounds. The 400-seat building was
opened debt-free, largely because of the donation of the timber used
in construction by Mr Storie, a member who owned a nearby timber mill.
This building was one of the largest churches in Queensland at that
time.

The development of the church is centred around the life and
ministry of Rev. Thomas Leitch. Born in Scotland in 1849 and receiving
his theological training there, the young minister arrived· in the
colony in the early 1870s and associated himself with the work of
Jireh Church. When Rev. John Straughen left Brisbane, Mr Leitch was
asked to pastor the new work at Red Hill.

It was the strong, dynamic preaching ministry of Thomas
Leitch that was primarily responsible for the growth of the church. A
number of small revivals occurred during this time, and by 1905, the
jubilee year of Baptist work in Queensland, the Windsor Road Church
reported a membership of 162 and a Sunday School of 275 - larger even
than Jireh. Thomas Leitch soon won the respect of Baptists in
Queensland and he was elected President of the Association (now Union)
for the year 1891-2.

Windsor Road was a strong missionary church, sending a
number of missionaries to overseas service, mainly in China and India.
One of them was Miss Kate Allenby who assisted Queensland first
Baptist missionary, Miss Martha Plested in East Bengal. Windsor Road
church was also involved in the formation of the Brisbane City
Mission. The pastor was on the management committee.

Thomas Leitch retired in May 1929 after 52 years in the
ministry at Windsor Road, his first and only pastorate! He returned
to Scotland for a brief visit, and then died unexpectedly at Port
Said, Egypt in September 1929 while returning to Brisbane. His funeral
at Windsor Road in December of that year was an occasion of great
sadness. His relatives financed the erection of a hall in his memory.
It was erected in 1933 on the northern side of the church building but
it was moved in the 1940s to the southern side where it now stands. It
is used extensively for church and denominational activities.

In 1930, Rev. A.H. Brooks commenced a five year ministry but
little information is available from this time. However, it does seem
that the earlier remarkable growth rate had levelled out by this time.
Membership remained at about 130. In 1935, Dr. H.W. Dart was called to
the pastorate. He thought of the church as being one "of considerable
strength and importance, probably second only to the main
Brisbane church, the Tabernacle." When he left in 1937 after being
called to a Sydney church, he had been instrumental in drawing up
plans for a new building (but it was never erected) and in maintaining
the strong financial and spiritual position of the cause at Red Hill.
This was also the time when the church began to drop the use of the
word ·Particular· in its title, and when open communion (with
individual cups) replaced close communion from a single vessel.

In 1937, Rev. Robert Horn assumed the responsibilities of
the pastorate when the membership was 136 with 180 Sunday School
pupils. Once again, records from this time are strictly limited, but
it was the time when Ashgrove Church was commenced. This and some
unhappiness in the church caused a dramatic drop in membership - down
to 66. Mr Horn himself left in 1943 to become the pastor at Ashgrove.

On December 3, 1944, the Welsh evangelist Gwynne Durward
became pastor. He was a dynamic person, but his prior ministry with
the Assemblies of God caused some initial problems. Under his
ministry, the church membership increased again to 81 (by 1962) but it
peaked at this number. Difficulties within the church caused a decline
so that when he retired in 1973, the membership had fallen to 34 and
the once large Sunday School was virtually non-existent.

Not being well placed to look after itself, the church came
under the control of the Baptist Union, which put it under the
supervision of the Ashgrove Church. Although some felt the church
should be closed, remaining members desired to persist in their
ministries. This determination was to lead to a renewed life for the
fellowship. Pastor Rod Bullpitt held an interim part-time ministry in
1974-5 while associated with Ashgrove, and he was followed by Pastor
Ron Simpson for another year.

In 1977, the centenary year of the church, Pastor (now Rev.)
Stephen Shaw took up the pastorate. Under his dynamic leadership, the
church has developed a comprehensive ministry, including student work,
Pastoral Care Fellowships, and church planting. Membership has almost
reached all-time record levels again. He has emphasised the priority
of commitment to and ministry through the local church. As a
consequence of this emphasis, the church has sought to recognize and
develop the spiritual gifts of its members for ministry in the church
and to the world. The church is led by a three-member pastoral team.
