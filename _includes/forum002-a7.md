## NATIONAL BAPTIST HISTORY 
The latest development in the establishment of a historical 
society has taken place in Western Australia. Dr.
Richard Moore, formerly of the Baptist Theological College
of Queensland, has been a leading figure in the formation
of a society there.

The Baptist Historical Society of N.S.W., led by its
President, Rev. Dr. Ken Manley, has been active with a
highly successful programme over many years. This Society 
is taking the lead in publication with three quality books
to its credit. It is now moving to initiate a national
Baptist history as part of its contribution to the Bi- _
Centennial celebrations. All Baptist Unions and Societies
have been invited to participate.

The February issue of "The Baptist Recorder" (the N.S.W.
Society's official journal) carried this explanation from
Mr. Michael Petras, who has been appointed co-ordinator of
the project.

We think this is an appropriate occasion for such 
an historic book. It will be, of course, the first
national history of Australian Baptists., As well,
it would be the first Protestant history written
on such a large scale to be published. 

{:.pi} 
In order to fund this project we applied to the
N.S.W. Council of the Australian Bicentennial
Authority last October. The result of this application 
for a grant under the N.S.W. Government's
history writing programme will not be known until
March.

{:.pi} 
With each applicant for this grant there is an
understanding that their project will also
receive funds through private sponsorship. To
this end we shall be looking to the support of
interested individuals, churches, organisations
and companies. 

{:.pi} 
As you can appreciate a research project of such
magnitude (to be accomplished in a relatively
short space of time) will require a considerable
period of full-time application to the task over 
the next three years. It will involve travel to
various parts of Australia to carry out research, 
collect photographs and so on. 

{:.pi} 
Most State Unions and the Baptist Union of 
Australia have warmly welcomsithe idea with 
assurances of their co-operation.

Mr. Petras expects to work full-time for two years 
on the project. He has already been in contact with the 
BHSQ seeking advice and help. This means.that there is 
an open opportunity for Queensland Baptists to make a
valuable contribution to what is likely to be an historic
development. 

There are at least two areas in which help is needed.
The finst is financially - to permit the research and
publication of the volume. The second is in the area of 
research and writing.· Members of historic and influential A
churches, pastors and officers of the Union and churches
who are alert to importance of our heritage and those who
want to invest their time, talent and money in a worth-
while project are all invited to become·involved.

One particular group of people may be particularly
interested in this project - and may well be in a position
to make a unique contribution. These are students -at the
theological college and at universities and colleges.
There are many research projects connected with Baptist
history that are waiting to be carried out. These would
comprise useful sources of data for the national Baptist
history. Help is needed in publicising this programme
and in enlisting helpers and financial sponsors. For
more details, contact Dr. Parker.
