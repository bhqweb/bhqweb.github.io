## The Jireh Honour Board Stars in Exhibition

The Honour Board from the Jireh Baptist Church has previously featured in these pages (QB December 2009, page 41). The board has had an interesting history since the closure of the Jireh church in 1978.

While the Queensland Remembers volunteers of the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee were located at the Voyager Centre in the historical precinct of the Kedron-Wavell RSL Club, one of the volunteers noticed in a cupboard, a large World War I Honour Board belonging to the Jireh Baptist Church.

Apparently, following the fire at the Baptist Church after its closure, the Honour Board had been taken to a dump.  It was discovered there in pieces, rescued and given to the Kedron-Wavell RSL. The RSL then gave it to the Woodworkers Group which was also located at the Voyager Centre. The woodworkers offered the Honour Board to the Queensland Remembers Project as they were reluctant to use the wood for other purposes. As a couple of the woodworkers were Returned Servicemen, this perhaps explains their reluctance.

When the Queensland Remembers Project moved to the National Storage Sheds at Aspley, there was a shortage of space and it was suggested that the Baptist Church be contacted so see if they would like to have the Honour Board back.  The offer was accepted and it was passed on to the Baptist Church Archives.

In November 2011 the Honour Board was lent back to the ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee to become an important part of the 2011 Remembrance Day Display in the foyer of the Executive Building in George Street.  Before it was displayed the board was restored to its original condition and became an impressive part of the Remembrance Day exhibition.
