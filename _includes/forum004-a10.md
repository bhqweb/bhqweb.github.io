## BAPTIST ARCHIVES, OUEENSLAND

The Baptist Union Archives is gradually collecting a
considerable quantity of valuable material. The Archives exists
primarily to house the records of the Union itself, rather than the
records of the churches, but where there is no other way of saving
important material, the Archives may be able to help with storage.
However, space is severely limited.

To help churches care for their own records, the honorary
archivist~ recently sent to all churches a copy of a form called
"lnventory of Historical Records for Local Churches." It contains
spaces to list the various records owned by the church with a brief
description of their coverage and state of repair. The lower part of
the form has space for information about the accessibility and control
of the records. It is suggested that copies of the completed form
should be lodged with responsible people in the church so that
information about the records and their use is available to aH
concerned. It would also help greatly if a copy were sent to the
Archivist and 'BHSQ because there are often requests for details of
churches and families. If the BHSSI knows what records exists and
whether or not they are accessible, the process of answering these
enquiries would be facilitated.

The Baptist Archives collection is now listed in the “Register
of Church Archives' which is published by the Church Archivists'
Society. This valuable book contains details of the contents and
accessibility of collections of historical materials from all over
Australia. lt is a most useful production for researchers. Copies may
be obtained from the honorary secretary, PD Box 756, Toowoomba, 4350
The Baptist Archives also possesses a copy.

Some churches have produced historical booklets about their
churches. The Archives possesses several of these, but not
necessarily all of them. The 'lnventory' also invites churches to
donate a copy of their official history as this can also be of great
assistance when answering questions about churches
