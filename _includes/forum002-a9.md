## BUUK REVIEW:
**LAMPLIGHTER AND SON**: The forgotten story of\\
Thomas Spurgeon of his famous father,\\
Charles Haddon Spurgeon, by Craig Skinner\\
Broadmans, 1984 RRP $19.50). 

Former Australian pastor and theological college teacher,
Dr. Craig Skinner, now Professor of preaching at Golden 
Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, U.S.A., has fina1ly
published the book he has been working on for a long time.
It is a semi-fictional biography which at the same time 
presents a great deal of factual material about the 
Spurgeon family, especially the_ministry of Thomas in
Australia and New Zealand.

Perhaps the innovative aspects of the book, such 
as the imaginative reconstruction of conversations and
the details of the lives of various people and the placingl
of 201 illustrations together in the centre of the book
t with the captions listed on three separate pages, will 
» not appeal to all readers. But the heart of the book,
the origins and developments of Thomas Spurgeon's
significant but often overlooked ministry, will be
appreciated by anyone with an interest in the establishment 
of several influential churches in the South Pacific.
It also focuses upon the so·called "Spurgeon tradition"
which has been of considerable importance in the direction
taken by Baptist life in various parts of Australia and
elsewhere.

Dr. Skinner's book also tackles the question of
Thomas Spurgeon's role in continuing his father's
ministry at the Metropolitan Tabernacle in London, which
he served as Pastor from 1894-1908. Backed up with a
large number of detailed references to primary and
secondary literature, this work presents a clear case
for the importance, power and gracious quality of the
younger Spurgeon's work in the face of enormous
difficulties. The fact that these problems finally 
overwhelmed him does not lessen the strategic importance 
of his labours.

But *Lampligher and Son* also has another agenda. The
author brings in a lot of extra material in an attempt to
clarify the relationships between the Spurgeons and other
ministries and movements of the day. In particular, he
wants to show that C.H. Spurgeon may have been the original 
stimulus for much early fundamentalism. Dr. Skinner 
emphasises that fundamentalism has often been misinterpreted 
so that it appears as a much more reactionary movement than
it was in the earliest and most authentic forms which were·
identified with the work of D.L. Moody, A.C. Dixon and the
booklets known as "The Fundamentals". Whether the case
is successfully made and whether the attempt to add this
second agenda to an already worthwhile theme was the wisest 
course of action — these are questions readers will want
to decide for themselves. But whatever the reservations
about the finer points of the book, it must be recognised as
an interesting addition to evangelical and Baptist history
and it augurs well for Dr. Skinner's Spurgeon presentations
in Australia in a few weeks time.

Two small typographical errors were noticed — the
second of which will cause a chuckle...p. 174 says Moody 
was "Calvinistic rather than Armenian" and p. 191 claims 
that Thomas Spurgeon made worthwhile "contribution to
theological immorality"!
