## Jireh Church Featured In British Baptist Historical Journal 

The Baptist Quarterly is the journal of the Baptist `
Historical Society of Great Britain. The October 1985 issue carries
an article called, 'Jireh Particular Baptist, Brisbane: Calvinism in
an Australian Conte4t.“ It was written by the president of the BHSO,
Dr David Parker, and tells the story of founding and early life of
Jireh Church which met in the building in Gipps St, Valley. (This
building is not in Baptist hands now.) The special emphasis of the
article is the beliefs and practices of the church as an example of
the Calvinist itheology held by its founders. The “Particular
Baptists' were an important section of the Baptist movement from the
middle of the 17th Century.
