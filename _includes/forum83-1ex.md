December 2012 is a milestone for the Archives-30 years since work began on organising the historical records of the Baptist Union. Read all about it in the article beginning page 2. There is plenty of work to be done yet as we move more completely into the digital age. (Two more important digital resources have been added recently and more are planned.) We can always use the help of good volunteers! (See our Secretary's 28th Annual Report p 8; Archivist's Report is also available-on request.)
There have been many other milestones this year as well. Lindum church closed down, as did Carey; Geebung and Sandgate merged to form a new church and opened a new building at Deagon; Gympie celebrated 125 years. Toowong opened a new extension to their building and were very proud to celebrate their heritage in the process-their main building is the oldest Baptist church in Queensland still in use. Minden has celebrated 130 years, while Rockhampton marked their 150th. Stanley River (Woodford) expanded to include another church in its circuit at Kilcoy. Silkstone has reached its centenary.

So there is plenty happening and Baptist Heritage Qld has had involvement with some of these, and the Archives has received some publications and materials as well. BHQ marked the Rockhampton event with the publication of its largest book yet-on the history of Baptist work in Central Queensland. There are still copies of this book, Something more than Gold, available (and the bundled special-with the Queensland 150th history, Pressing on with the Gospel). We also ventured into e-book publishing with versions of the CQ history!

Our next publishing venture will be a long awaited update of the popular Baptists in Queensland. We have updated also the National Guide to Australian Baptist Resources and Services which will be ready soon. Check our website for the on-line version. We also hope to tackle Baptists in the Darling Downs soon, and we will be announcing the winner of 2012 Essay competition as well.

We need more people to join in with us and help us complete our big slate of 2013 projects!
