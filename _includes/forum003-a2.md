## The Small Woman

Our next meeting will feature -Martha Plested, Queensland's
small woman," We are pleased to associate with us the Department of
Mission oÂ·f the Baptist Union which is currently celebrating 100 years
since she left for E. Bengal with the four other missionaries who made
up "the five barley loaves." She was Queensland's first (and for a
long time sole!) Baptist missionary. The meeting will be held at
Taringa Baptist Church on Monday August 26th at 7.30pm. As a 
special feature, we will display lantern slides from the Baptist Archives of
the type used by Martha in her extensive Bible teaching ministry.
Invite your church and friends to join us. (See also back page)
