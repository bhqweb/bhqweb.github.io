## News From New South Wales

The NSW Baptist Historical Society was formed in 1974 and
has recently conducted its annual meeting. Their publication THE
BAPTIST RECORDER carries news, announcements and papers prepared by
members. The society has been active with regular meetings and a
growing literature publication programme. So far, three books have
been published.

Their most ambitious project is the proposal to produce a
"Bi-Centennial History of Australian Baptists" in conjunction with the
celebrations in 1988. The outcome of their application to the BiCentennial
Authority for funding is not yet known, but if successful,
it will enable the treasurer of the Society, Mr Michael Petras to work
full-time on the project. The NSW Society is anxious to enlist the
resources of Baptist Historical Societies and interested people ln
other states as well to make this a worthwhile production.

Another major topic which the NSW Society has, been
considering is the biography of the former principal of the NSW
Baptist Theological College, the late Rev. G. H. Morling. Rev. Ron
Rogers, current principal of the college, has produced two erudite
lectures on this topic so far for presentation to the society. They
have been reproduced in THE AUSTRALIAN BAPTIST. Since "G.H.M." was
such a significant figure in NSW and Australian Baptist life, Mr
Rogers' work is of great importance.

Other papers due for presentation to the NSW Society include
"The Jubilee of the Cronulla Church" by Rev. John Giles; "Hyper
Calvinism in Strict and Particular Baptist Churches in Australia" by
Rev. Michael Chavura and "The Contribution of the Ardill Family to the
Baptist .Cause in NSW" by Mr Hubert Watkin-Smith, a vice-chairman of
the Society and the editor of its magazine.

Historical societies also exist in Victoria and West
Australia. Details of the essay competition being conducted by the
NSW Society were published in the last edition of this newsletter.Â·
Closing date is September 30, 1985. The chairman of the Society is
Rev. Dr Ken Manley, pastor of Epping Baptist Church. The mailing
address of the society is c/- Baptist Theological College of NSW, 120
