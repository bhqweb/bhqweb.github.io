## German Baptist Conference -- Special Issue

This special issue of the BHSQ NEWSLETTER is devoted to the
celebration of the ministry and witness of the German Baptist
Conference, the organised form of the German Baptist Churches in the
area west of Ipswich up until about 1930. After that the churches
entered fully into the life of the Baptist Union of Queensland and
adopted local -English- or -AustralianM (?) ways in place of some
rather distinctive German practices.

Over the last twenty years, several of these churches have
celebrated their own centenaries and have published printed histories
of their work. German work as a whole has been written up in the
official histories of the Baptist Union (1905 and 1977) and in a
thesis for the Baptist Theological College of Queensland by Rev. P. G.
Bryant. These works have been indebted to the custodians of the
records and to translators of German language material.

But in recent times, Mr Glenn Roberts has collected a great
deal more material and information and has translated many more
records. Now that so much material is available, it seems fitting to
focus on the ministry of this group of churches which for 120 years
has made such an important contribution to Baptist witness in
Queensland. This issue of the BHSQ NEWSLETTER contains a printed
version of material presented at a celebration held at Laidley Baptist
Church on Saturday July 5th 1986 sponsored by the Baptist Historical
Society and the German Baptist Churches.
