## QUEENSLAND'S FIRST MISSIONARY - INFORMATION WANTED

Information is needed about Queensland's first Baptist
missionary, Miss Martha Plested. ABMS Mission Development 
Officer, Rev. George Stubbs, has approached the BHSQ for
5 help in finding information about Miss Plested for celebrating,
latcr in 1985, of the centenary of the formation
of the Queensland branch of the mission.

The Queensland Baptist Foreign Mission was formed on 
June 1, 1885 at a meeting attended by Ellen Arnold,
Australia's pioneer missionary. The funds amounted to a
respectable £110. At the first regular meeting of the
mission about a month later, the first application was 
discussed. It was from Martha Plested, a member of Jireh
Church. Only two weeks later, it was decided to accept
her application, and she was on her way to India by the
end of September that same year! Three other young ladies
joined Ellen Arnold, and the group became known as the
"Five Barley Loaves".

Martha Plested worked first with the South Austrlian
mission at Fureedpore, until a separate station was established 
by her at Noakheli·in November 1888. Ill-health
caused her premature return home only a year later. But
in November 1890 she was able to journey to India again 
in company with Miss Kate Allenby of Windsor Road Church.

Miss Plested worked on, often alone, until 1918, when
she retired. She lived for some time in a small house a
little distance from Noakhali. But her health deteriorated
Lo such an extent that it was not possible for missionaries
to care for her adequately. She was sent back to Australia,
and arrived in Sydney in September 1922, but was too ill to
return to Brisbane. She was lovingly cared for until her
death three months later. Her funeral service took place
s at the City Tabernacle, led by the President of the Baptist
Association (Union) Rev. Ralph Sayce. She was buried at
the Toowong Cemetry where an imposing marble monument was
erected in her memory. It reads, "Pioneer Missionary in
India of the Queensland Baptist Churches. Laboured in
Bengal for 37 years and fell asleep at Sydney on 22nd
December. Aged 68 years".

Records of Miss Plested's life and work are not
plentiful. In order to make the ABMS celebrations as
significant as possible, an urgent request goes out to
readers who may have access to information. If any such
information is available, please contact the President of
the Baptist Historical Society or Mr. Stubbs, as soon as
possible.
