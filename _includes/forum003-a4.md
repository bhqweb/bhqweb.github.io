## Recent Acquisitions for Baptist Archives
There is a steady trickle of material being donated to the
Baptist Archives which are located in the basement of the Baptist
headquarters, Brunswick House, in the Valley. Some of these items are
unusual and of particular interest.

Perhaps the most unusual received recently was an
elaborately inlaid wooden writing desk. It is a table-top model which
opens out to form a sloped writing surface with space underneath for
paper and an ink-well and pen holder at the top. Overall, it is about
40 by 22 by 15cms when folded up. It is in fair condition.

According to an "illustrated address" fixed inside it, this
writing desk was presented to Thomas Edward Jones when he left the
"Sabbath School" of the South Brisbane Baptist Church on 10 June 1881.
The address includes these words:
  
	 We desire to express the pleasure we have experienced in
	 working with you in our different spheres of labor in the
	 cause of Christ, and hope that, wherever you may go you will
	always remain a faithful servant of our Lord. We heartily
	wish you success in your new duties, and trust that you may
	become eminent in the profession you have chosen, as well,as
	proving a blessing to your fellow-creatures.

This valuable link with the past came to the Archives from
the late Mrs Anne Dorothy Lubeck through the good
sister, Mrs Roberts and Mr David Gibson, curator of
Newstead House. Mrs Lubeck was a collector of antiques.

Other material that has come to the Archives recently
includes a large number of photographs from Mr Ken Smith and the late
Miss M.P. Smith. There are several albums, containing many photos
which are identified. They provide a link with earlier days of the
Baptist churches in Queensland when Mr W.R. Smith was prominent figure
in the denomination. A number of photographs and other small itells
connected with Christian Endeavour have been received from Mrs A.
Brown of Woody Point.

The material with perhaps the most potential of all for
future investigation is a large bundle of papers connected with German
Baptist, Churches. Mr Glenn Roberts of the Windsor Road Church has
been working on this material for some time now. He has even travelled
to Germany to do research in libraries and archives there. He has now
collected some of the material and given copies to the Baptist
Archives and made some also available to the John Oxley Library. (One
interesting document that he has worked on will be the subject of an
article in a future edition and it 15 hoped that his work will be
presented at a meeting of the Society as well.)

The John Oxley Library has recently acquired some papers of
Rev. William Higlett. It is expected that xerox copies of transcripts
of some of these will be available to the Archives in due course.
Conversely, the John Oxley Library expects to make microfilm copies of
some early Baptist periodicals held only in the Archives. This will
make them more accessible and protect, the originals from damage
through use.

To eliminate any unnecessary problems, suggestions from the
Church Archivists' Society are now being followed in acquisition
procedure. The Baptist Union office has a simple record slip for use
When material is donated. A full description of how to operate
collection of historical material may be found in the book "The Small
Archive" published by the Church Archivists' Society.
