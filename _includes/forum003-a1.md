## Time to Review!

This is our 3rd Newsletter and it marks the end of the first year of operation of the Baptist Historical Society of Queensland. Thanks to all those who have contributed to the life of the Society so far. you have helped BHSQ to get off the ground. It now remains to see where we go from here!

Later in this Newsletter you will find a report of the first year's activity. The annual meeting will be held as part of the next regular meeting of the Society (see below) and there we will need to decide about the future. Our sincere thanks is due to our founding sec:retary, Rev, Owen Gregory who has served during the year. He has found it' neccessary to reliriquish his position as he is moving from his pastorate to other work. (This Newsletter is being produced under difficulty without his help!) Membership currently stands at 20, whith is a good start, but unless is grows, it is only just enough to make the Society viable. Similarly, the current membership fee only provides us with a basic budget.

So we invite members and friends of the BHSQ to consider the future development of the Society and come to the next meeting prepared to make decisions about the future. A good deal of interest has been created by the Society and we want to develop as effectively as possible.
