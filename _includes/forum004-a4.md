## Research In Progress

One of the main purposes of the Baptist Historical Society is to
foster informed interest in the story of Baptists in Queensland. This
can be done in a variety of ways, including providing a forum for the
presentation of research into aspects of Baptist history and life.
Several examples of this have already taken place in the public
meetings of the Society which have focused on the history of churches
like South Brisbane and windsor Road and the life of Mr. E.S. Jones.

Other examples are also going on at present. Une is the
painstaking pieting together of the life of the first principal of the
Baptist Theological College of Queensland, Rev. T.C. Halyon, F.S.Sc.
He held office from 1904-21. Rev. John white says of him in the
official Baptist history, "He had trained in Regent's Park College and
had revealed great teaching ability. He served in pastorates in
Victoria before coming to Queensland to the pasturate at Ipswich. For
many years he carried the dual load, retiring from pastoral work only
a few years before his death (in 1921). His was a true pioneering work
in this field and Queensland Baptists will always be indebted to him
for it." (p 136)

The other project is an investigation of the nature of Baptist
church buildings over the years. This is being done from the point of
view of what the style and form of the buildings indicates about
Baptist life and beliefs. There is quite a variety of buildings to be
seen today and to have an in·depth analysis of them will prove to be
interesting and should result in a clearer perception of the
importance influence they can have.

A further piece of work is an investigation of the various
distinctive beliefs of leading Baptists over the years as they are
revealed in available documents.

It is hoped that when these projects are completed, they will
form the basis for a public presentation. Useful information relating 
to either of them is welcome
