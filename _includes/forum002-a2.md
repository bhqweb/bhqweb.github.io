## CITY TABERNACLE LISTED ON THE NATIONAL TRUST 
### BHSQ meeting marks this recognition

A small but interested group of people met in the
parlour of the Tabernacle on Monday 1st October, 1984, 
to celebrate the recognition by the National Trust of
the Tabernacle Church. The meeting featured a series
of presentations pointing out the significance of the 
building and of the National Tnust's activities.

The opening presentation was a video prepared by 
the church, showing the wide-ranging ministry of the
church. The video was originally prepared for use
during the Commonwealth Games when city churches were
I open to visitors. The BHS is grateful to the church
for the use of the video and for its presentation.

Official Union historian, Rev. John White, then
presented a comprehensive review of the significance
of the church for Queensland Baptists. His paper
covered many aspects of the church’s role both as a
local church and as a denominational centre.

A special feature of the evening was an address
by Mrs. Rae Sumner of the National Trust. Mrs. Sumner
prepared the citation concerning the Tabernacle for the 
Trust. In her address, she explained the·work of the
Trust and the processes used for deciding upon recognition 
of buildings. Her work also included researching 
the history and architecture_of the church. Several 
Trust publications were also on display and available 
to those attending.

The final segment of the meeting was in the hands 
the present pastor, Rev. Paul Harrison. He outlined 
some aspects of the church's present ministry and 
discussed factors affecting its role as a city church.

Before supper was served, those attending took the 
opportunity to inspect the display of historical items 
relating to the church. Those who were not familiar 
with the church were also able to join a brief tour of 
inspection.
