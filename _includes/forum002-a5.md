## BHSQ MEMBERSHIP â€” GROWING!

According to current records, membership in the Baptist 
Historical Society of Queensland stands at twenty three.
The Secretary/Treasurer, Rev. Owen Gregory, said "This is
a good start, seeing that the Society is not yet a year old.
However, we believe there are many more people and churches
who would like to show their support and become involved".
He explained, "Membership is only $5. a year, which also
includes the cost of the Newsletter, These subscriptions 
are the only source of income at present. We have hopes
of developing displays, audio-visual presentations and
literature. A larger membership will enable us to move
in this direction." Mr. Gregory also reported on the
financial situation, as follows: "Having paid all expenses 
to date, we have a credit balance of $11.15."
