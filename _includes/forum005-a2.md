## THE BEGINNINGS OF THE GERMAN BAPTIST WITNESS
### By Rev. John White, M.A.

The colony of Queensland was destined to be considerably
influenced by Christian Gertlan migrants and their families. Indeed,
the influence had started to operate before the colony was separated
from New South Wales in 1859.

The formal establishment of Baptist work in Queensland was due
to the Baptists who came to the colony in 1849 under the British
migration scheme which had been promoted by Rev. Dr. John Dunmore
Lang. However, that work was indebted to the prior activity of the
earliest German settlers, and was to be further indebted to the direct
contribution made by many of these after the first church was formed
in 1855.

It is one ol the mysteries of providence why people should elect
to leave their homeland to settle in a new and untamed land. If we
believe in an active divine purpose in all things, we can thank God
for his leading, by which so many Christians were moved to come to
this colony.

As for the German migrants in the mid-1900s and later, there
were some understandable reasons. In short, life in Europe had serious
economic, social and religious disadvantages. The coming of industry
and the decline of agriculture had an unsettling effect. Life became
more difficult for a people of the land. The social changes were
irksome. Military demands were growing for a people who loved their
land and were content with their work in peaceful and quiet conditions.
Religious persecution was not unknown.

Under the circumstances, the burgeoning forth of life. in the new
world would be pictured as a dream come true. Reports circulating told
of its climate and soil, its facilities and freedom, and its gold.
Itlmigration officers sold this vision, and by the mid-1800s were
attracting large numbers, including some thousands who then or later
came to Queensland. They were to find the great benefits, but also the
hardships of pioneering life.

The first Germans to come to Queensland were a truly apostolic
twelve, together with their families. They also came as a result of
the work of Dr Lang. He had gone overseas to enlist missionaries for
the proposed evangel ising of the aborigine:i of the Moreton Bay area.
Failing to find them in Britain, he turnnd to a group trained in
Germany for missionary purposes in the school of the Lutheran. Dr
Johannes E. Gassner, who had founded a miss~onary society in 1836.

These missionaries became the first ':ree white settlers in the
Moreton Bay area. In 1824 a penal settl~~nt had been set up. It
closed in the early 18405. The first of I.he missionaries landed at
Humpy Bong, near the present Redcliffe, il March 1838. Later, they
transferred to the Nundah area. There, on Zlon's Hill, and adjacent to
Kedron Brook, they built rough houses, a school and a chapel. The
mission work was full of difficulty and ~,a5 closed by 1850. The
period, it is noted, bridged the days of pellal and free settlement.

It is interesting to observe that when the Mission closed, only
five of the original missionaries were still associated with it. Three
of these, together with one who had come to reinforce the mission
strength, can be certified as having Baptist leanings, and later,
definite Baptist affiliations. They were Zillman, Franz, Rode and
Gerler. They had links with the Wharf Street Baptist Church, formed in
1855, and the work at Hendra (now Clayfield' which started in 1869.

These Christian leaders may well have served to influence
migrants to come to Queensland. After the Mission closed, they found
settlement on the land or in trade, and were deeply attached to the
land of opportunity. The reports of theJrexperiences, if not their
per!lonal appeal, would dispose lIany to join them. In the event, frail
whatever motive, Germans who were, or were to become, Baptists arrived
in large numbers from the 18:50s and into the 1870s.

Following the initial settlement in the vicinity of German
Station (Nundah), these migrants were scattered in several directions.
Some stayed around Brisbane. Some moved !louth toward!l Logan to engage
in far~ing pur!luits. Some probably moved towards Caboolture. The
greater number, however, ~oved towards Ipswich. Some halted at Redbank
Plains. Most, however, had the intention of seeking the rich lands of
the Brisbane and Breller Rivers. They were ultimately to find their
homes in a wide surrounding Circle, and ·to form many thriving
churches. 

An interesting development, relating to the whole German work
from the early days, was based on a link sustained with the Ipswich
church. A special and much appreCiated interest was shown by the Rev.
T.S. Gerrard, the Ipswich pastor during the years 1869-1874. He
probably welcomed thell as they passed through the town. In 1869, one
of the groups sought fellowship with the Ip!lwich church and asked for
whatever lIinistry it could offer. This was repeated by the group froll
Norllanby in the following year.

This enquiry was the small beginning of fellowship which led to
the formation of the first AS!lociation of Baptist Churche!l in
Queensland. It linked the Ipswich church with the fellow!lhips of
Brisbane River, Norllanby Reserve, Mt Walker, Rosewood Scrub and
Fassifern Scrub.

At sOlie time before 187:5, conferences were initiated by ·The
South Queensland German Baptist Union.· This was later to become ·The
Conference of German Bapti!lt Churches in Queensland.· It was the
formation of this AS!lociation between Ip!lwich and the churches of the
surrounding area which !ltirred action leading to the formation of the
Queensland Baptist Associatin (Union) into which the German churches
integrated in later years as full and valued members.
