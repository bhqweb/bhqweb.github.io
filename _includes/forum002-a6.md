## SORT YOUR CHURCH'S HISTORICAL RECORDS

The BHSQ has prepared a handy form which will help
churches and other bodies to sort and record details of
their historical materials in an efficient and comprehensive
manner. The_form provides space for listing and describing 
of various items, such as minute books, membershib rolls,
photographs etc., indicating the dates covered, the number
and type of materials, and the physical conditions. Another
section of the form allows space for details of the church's
official published history to be recorded. There is also a
section which encourages church officers to develop clear
policy on storage, care and accessibility of_records. 
Copies of the information can be given to various church 
officers so that there is adequate knowledge of the material
amongst those responsible. 

The President of the Society, Dr._Parker, said, "This 
simple procedure will produce effective results and is ideal
for churches - particularly those that are wondering what to
do with their records". He added, "If the church decides 
their records will be made available to bona fide researchers,
hen there is also provision for a copy of the form to be
lodged with the BHSQ so that enquirers can be directed to
the right person without unnecessary bother." 

Copies of the form are available from Dr. Parker upon
receipt of a stamped addressed envelope.
