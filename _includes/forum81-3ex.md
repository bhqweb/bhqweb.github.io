## Warwick Baptist Church Centenary Celebrations 18-20 Nov 2011
#### Bill Hughes, Baptist Heritage Queensland

On 19 November 1911 then President of the Baptist Association of Queensland (now called the Baptist Union of Queensland) conducted the opening services of the newly formed Warwick Baptist Church.  On 18-20 November 2011 the church celebrated its centenary with three days of celebrations. Bill Hughes wrote a centenary history for Warwick and also participated in the celebrations. He reports here on the events and our articles also includes some information from his history about the Warwick church.

### Warwick The Rose City

Warwick would have to be one of the most beautiful provincial cities in Australia, and it looked its best in the Spring of 2011 with the roses beginning to bloom down the main street and the gardens and parks around the city looking extra tidy and ablaze with colour.

The citizens of Warwick are a friendly lot and as Roslyn and I wandered around the town a number of people chatted with us and were interested to know the reason for our visit.  When we explained that we were there to attend the centenary celebrations of the Warwick Baptist Church, without exception they all seemed to know about the event.  We were aware that the church had a large banner on it, in which the centenary was being advertised and assumed that other forms of advertising had also been employed.

People in the main shopping mall in the centre of town (Rose City Mall) seemed to be fully aware of the Baptist churchs celebrations.  We soon discovered the reason for this.  The mall had a large advertisement in a prominent position in one of the main entries.  It was difficult to miss, quite large and very colourful, and it caught the eye as we walked past it.
