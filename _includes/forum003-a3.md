## Our First Year

The Baptist Historical of Qld. was inaugurated at a meeting
held at the Windsor Rd. Baptist Church hall an May 1st, 1984 when a
representattve group adopted the suggestion put forward by a steering
committee. A constitution was adopted and officers were elected to
manage the Society. Dr. David Parker, chairman of the meeting was
appointed President and Rev. Owen Gregory, secretary-treasurer.
Featured speaker'at the meeting was "official" Baptist historian, Rev.
John White. The General Superintendent of the Baptist Union, Rev.
Brian Jenkins, brought the greetings of the Union. A number of
enthusiastic people signed up for membership immediately.

At the background of this meeting lay some earlier
developments. For many years, the Baptist Union had appointed a
committee which was known as the "Baptist Hisorical Society." However,
with the growth of interest in historical matters both in the
wider society and amongst Baptists elsewhere, it was felt there might
be a place for a voluntary society instead of Simply a functional
committee. At the same time, the Baptist Union archives were being
made more orderly and accessible, thus providing a worthwhile source
for historical information. Similarly, a number of churches were
coming close to significant anniversaries and some theological
students were choosing to write on historical topics for their
graduation projects. It was hoped that all of these factors might have
given a new-style historical society a welcome and useful role amongst
Baptist people.

The first regular meeting of· the new society was held at
South Brisbane Church on July 16th when a series of speakers dealt
with the practical subject of how to prepare a local church history.
They included Rev. Larry Holt, Rev. John Ward and Dr. David Parker.
The papers they presented were printed in the first issue of our
Newsletter, published in September, and so were available to wider
audience. They were reprinted from this in the Newsletter of the
Church Archivists' Association and so reached a national readership.

During the year, the National Trust placed the City
Tabernacle Church onto its register of buildings "worthy of
preservation as part of the national heritage." This was an honour
worth celebrating,  so the Society met at the Tabernacle on Monday
October 1st, to hear Rev. John White and the pastor of the church,
Rev. Paul Harrison, speak about the significance of the church. Also
featured was a representative of the Trust who answered many questions
about its work. A video of the church's ministry was also screened.

A variety of meetings have also been held in 1985. The first
was a workshop at the Baptist Archives on Saturday March 30 when
several "person"-hours of work was done. Another style of meeting was
held at the Tabernacle on April 20, when the society supported the
multi-media presentation by Dr. Craig Skinner of U.S.A. (formerly of
Queensland) of the life and ministry of Charles Haddon Spurgeon.

The latest meeting was held once again at Windsor Road on
June 17, when Brian Robertson, an associate pastor of the church,
assembled a large number of interesting photographs and other items
and presented an overview of the history of hte church. He· was ably
assisted by one of the older adherents of the church who was able to
speak of the days when the church was at the peak of its strength.

The society was represented with a display at the 1984
Assembly of the Baptist Union. It consisted of a large folding board,
donated by one of our members. It was fitted out with a descriptive
sign and also featured a display of photos from the Archives, which
created a deal of interest amongst some Assembly delegates. It is
hoped that another display can be mounted at the 1985 Assembly.

Two issues of the Newsletter have been issued with 8 and 10
pages each. They have been posted to all our members and to a number
of other persons and groups. It was anticipated that 3 or 4 numbers
would be produced per year. Postage and production costs need to be
watched, of course. Several articles have been reproduced in the
Church Archivists' Society newsletter.

As well as these programme of public meetings, there has
been quite a deal of interest created by the Society. There have been
numerous requests for historical information, mostly channelled
through the Baptist Union office. The Archives have received some
worthwhile additions and it is expected that the John Oxley Library
will begin microfilming some material in the Archives in the near
future, thus making it more readily available to researchers. There
have also been some encouraging reports of people and, churches being
stimulated to take a more active interest in historical matters. To
assist churches in a practical way, an "Inventory of Historical
Records for Local Churches" has been prepared and made available to
those requesting it.

Membership at the end of the first year was 20 and the bank
account had a balance of $22.65. The $5 per annum membership fee may
need to be increased for 1985-6 if the society is to be more active.

Sincere appreciation is expressed to those who have
supported the Society and its meetings in the past year. Particular
thanks goes to our speakers, and especially to Rev. Owen Gregory as
founding secretary-treasurer. Nominations are called for his
replacement and for a small management committee. These elections
will take place at the annual meeting of the Society which will be
held at the Taringa Church on Monday August 26th at 7.30pm. The main
presentation will be "Martha Plested, Queensland's Small Woman." The
meeting will celebrate the centenary of the outgoing of Martha,
Queensland's first Baptist missionary. The BHSQ is associated with the 
Australian Baptist Missionary Society in this meeting.
