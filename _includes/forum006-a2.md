## N.S.W. NOTES

The Baptist Historical Society of N.S.W. continues to thrive with a
busy programme of activities. It has about ~O personal members and
about a dozen churches.

At a recent meeting, at which the President of the Queensland Society
was present and gave greetings, the N.S.W. president, Dr Ken Manley,
spoke about the 1~0 years of Central Baptist Church. He has been
preparing the official sesqui-centenary history and spoke somewhat
informally of his discoveries. The text of his lecture has been
published in the BHS of NSW newsletter~ The Baptist Recorder.

Dr Manley will shortly be leaving N.S.W. to take up an apPointment as
head of Whitley College in Melbourne. Special mention will be made of
his work with the Society at its October meeting. Dr Manley
participated in a historical conference under the auspices of the
Baptist World Alliance in Singapore in mid-1986.

The N.S.W. Society will sponsor another essay competition which calls
for papers of 5000-7000 words on any aspect qf Australian Baptist
history or theme in Baptist life. Details will be published in The
Australian Baptist.

The next publication of'the society will be a history of the Parramatta
Church, written by Mr H. Watkin-Smith. The Society has also received a
large volume of papers from the late Rev. William Higlett covering the
period 1910-44. Some earlier material covering Mr Higlett's time in
Queensland is at the State Library of Queensland, and a copy of some of
it is now in the Baptist Archives.
