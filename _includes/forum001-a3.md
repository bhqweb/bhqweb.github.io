## Researching and Writing Your Church History.

- by Rev. Larry Holt

### SOME INITIAL TASKS
1. Gain permission from the church to have access to their records.
2. Some historical work may already have been written. If so, find this and you may well be able to build on it.
3. Compile a complete list of the church annual statistics from the Baptist Union year books. If you can't locate these books elsewhere, the Baptist College has a complete set in its library.
4. Compile a chronological list of the pastors who have served in the church and the dates that they served. This information should also be in the year books, as the pastor of the church is named for each year.\\
\*\*\*\* At this point, you will be able to draw some graphs and visualise all this information on paper. A good suggestion would be to draw a graph, showing the membership for every year of the church's life, then shade in the periods that each different pastor has served.

### Resources

1. Church records 
  - Minutes of members' meetings .
  - Minutes of deacons' meetings
  - Records/roll books from all departments
  - The marriage register
  - Annual reports
  - Old photos\\
  \\  
NOTE: don't give up too easily if at first you can't find
what you are looking for. More often than not
these old records can be found. Keep asking and
keep looking!

2. People   \\
Contact and talk to people who have knowledge about the church, includlng names that appear in the minute books. 

- Pastors whohave served in the church (also, if possible talk to children and wives of the pastors, they will often have seen things from a different angle.)
- Members of the community who may have never come to the church, but maybe they 1ived next door for years, and know a good deal about it!
- Members and pastors of nearby churches may know something of your church.
- Baptist—Union personnel who may have had some form of contact»with the church.
- Residents of Baptist aged homes. They may not have been members of your church, but many of them have moved in Baptist circles all their lives and they may have helpful information to share.

### Some Notes About Conducting Interviews

Nearly everyone will be only too happy to talk about what they
can remember about your church, but a few guidelines are
offered.

1. Ring for permission and make an appointment w1th the person.
2. Do some preparation before you go. A good suggestion is to take with you a list of questions to ask, based on what you think the person may be able to tell you.
3. It is often easiest to use a small tape recorder to record all the conversation. This way you will miss nothing.\\
Note: Some people (especially older folk) may be wary of a tape recorder. You may need to reassure them of its purpose. You may need to do without it if the person cannot relax with it on.
4. Be flexible - your questions may well prod the memory of the person. Allow the person all the time they like in answering the questions. Be patient, but try to guide the conversation to avoid too much needless talk.
5. Always thank the person for their time.
6. Be sure it is permissible to reproduce anything that they have told you.
7. Ask if they have any documents they can show you or lend you. (If so, take extreme care with them).
8. When you get home, listen to the tape and make some notes from it.

### Miscellaneous Resources
The list of resources is unending. Information can come from even the unlike1iest of places; A few suggestions usually worth pursuing are -
- Baptist Union year books — ‘A Fellowship of Service’ by Rev. John White (A history of the Baptist Union of Queensland).
- Old copies of the Australian and Queensland Baptists
- Local newspapers
- Town/Shire council records
- Local histories written - check local library
- Australian Bureau of Statistics\\
(Note: This is one resource of which you really ought to take
full advantage. `A wealth of information is available)

### All This Information, Then What ??? 

You will now have acquired masses of information and you'll 
probably be wondering what on earth you are going to do with
it all.

1. Overview the whole thing. 
- Look use significant events
- Locate turning polnts,.peaks, etc.
2. Determine your basic approach\\
Basically there are two approaches\\
a. _Chronological_ - i.e., written in the order it happened. This method is easier for future researchers to use and for readers to follow the sequence of dates and events. It is, however, more difficult to keep 'readable'.\\
b. _Subject by subject_ - i.e. You write about one subject
at a time and,follow it through. e.g. the Pastors, the
Sunday School work, the buildings, etc.
\\ \\
This method usually makes more interesting reading, but
can be more-confusing and perhaps unwieldly if events and
topics are closely inter-connected.
\\ \\
_Personally_ I think a combination of these two methods
works best - i.e. you write the history chronologically,
but within your designated divisions you cover the material subject by subject. 

3. Determine your basic divisions\\
Once you have decided on your approach, you can divide the
material up into sections. If it is a lengthy account, you
ought to use chapter divisions. 
\\ \\
NOW you,can begin to sort out all your information that you
have gathered. A good suggestion would be to have a manilla
folder for each of your basic divisions and sort your information into these folders.

4. Second stage of research \\
You will probably notice that some of your folders are very
thick whilst others are rather thin. You come to what we
call a second stage of research where you have to do some
more research on those areas where you lack adequate material.

### Some Suggestions To Keep In Mind Whilst Writing

1. A balance is needed\\
Even after further research, some sections may be thin. However, try to keep some sort of balance between the divisions.\\
Try also to keep a balance between positive and negative. Like most other things, the only news you ever hear about is bad news! So make sure you include material about the good parts of the church's story, and about the not so good.
2. Keep it simple
3. Keep it readable
4. Try to distinguish between facts and opinions. All written history is interpretive, but try to separate your own assessments from the facts as much as possible but don't make your account merely a string of facts. You are writing a story, not a catalogue.
5. Make use of photos, charts, graphs, diagrams, etc. all of these will add to the general interest of your work.
6. Acknowledge your sources and always make sure that any persons you quote have given you permission to do`so.
7. Check your spelling and punctuation.

#### Lastly.....Evaluate

This is somethlng that is very important but sadly it is very seldom done.

1. READ IT THROUGH YOURSELF \\
Ask yourself — "What impression does it convey?"\\
"Is this the right 1mpression?"
2. LET OTHERS READ IT\\
Some suggestions would be ...\\
  a. Your oral sources\\
  b. someone completely outside the situation\\
  c. an English teacher\\
  d. someone who is familiar with Baptist history and the writing of it
  
After you have asked a number of people to read it and
comment, you may find it necessary to do a second draft.
After the second draft, allow only one person to read it
and comment.

#### YOUR WORK-SHOULD THEN BE FINISHED `
