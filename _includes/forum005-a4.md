## THE CONFERENCE OF GERHAN BAPTISTS IN SOUTH-EAST QUEENSLAND
### by Glenn Roberts

Sometime in 1874, tHO church assemblies comprising a unique
ethnic minority, German migrants of Baptist persualion, called after
their place names Brisbane River and Haunt Walker, festively met and
formed an association. Both had been formed separately about ten
years previously as these pioneering migrants Moved outwards from
Brisbane. The -South Queensland German Baptist Society- was to grow to
over three times its size and last for about sixty years, though
undergoing several reforms and many setbacks.

They were brought together by powerful forces - isolation and a
sense of minority and, most important of all, spiritual hunger. There
was an understandable urge for fellowship with those of common mind
and origin amongst the settlers in the new land, which wal regarded
also as a mission field by many of them. Another factor was language -
it would have been of little help to meet with Englilh-Ipeaking
Baptists based at the nearest town, Ipswich and elsewhere.

Their feelings Here often expressed in reports sent back to
Germany for printing in missionary magazines. The earliest known
report of this kind was from Brother Heinrich Holler of Normanby
Reserve (dated 6 July 1871) to the founder of the German Baptist
movement, Rev. J. G. Oncken. He said, -While our assembly arose about
four years ago from five members, the number now amounts to 60.- He
also spoke of a -richly blessed Pentecost with a Lovefeast- at which
25 people were converted. PJstor H. Windolf wrote later about the
arrival of the first Baptists in June 1865, of the first converts in
the Nundah area and of outreach to Normanby Station. Other reports
referred to the opening of a chapel at Mt Walker in October 1871 when
friends from many districts gathered for fellowship, and also of a
thriving work on the Brisbane River near Lowood.

These early foundations of the 'Conference were extended in 1875
when a third member joined the group, the church at Fassifern Scrub
(Kalbar or Engelsburg). The next to join was -Rosewo,od Scrub(
Marburg) in 1876. It had gained some members by transfer fro. ,Mt
Walker and was -the most important German settlement in which a few
thousand Germans are said to live- - to use Pastor Windolf's words.
They were also joined by some frOM the ZillMere area.

A report from Mt Walker dated 9 April 1877 (the lame year as the
Baptist Union of Queensland was being cO.Menced) said -six churches
have now arisen, with 300 members and five chapels. - Only 31 of these
were believers on arrival fro. Germany! At a meeting in Marburg, 200
were present at an Easter love-feast, and 72 pounds was sent to
Germany towards procuring a preacher. It was through -draWing together
(Zusammenziehen) newly migrated brethren and growth of new convertsthat
isolation was overcome and solidarity achieved.

A major need of the conference churches was met in 1878 when the
long-awaited trained pastor arrived from Germany in the person of
Pastor Hermann Windolf. A joyful description of this event was
reported in the missionary magazine. It was also noted that a second
worker would soon be required. However, the new arrangements resulted
in a breakdown in the fledgling conference because of personal and
policy differences between Pastor Windolf and the lay leaders at
Fassifern.

Minor meetings were still convened betHeen the churches in the
succeeding years, as is indicated by scattered reports in German
periodicals. For example, there was a new Bethel chapel at Harburg to
which members from Brisbane River, Brisbane and even the Logan Here
invited. In September 1881, a small conference met at Marburg
including members from Zillman's Waterholes.

\*Peace between Marburg, FASSIFERN and Ht Walker- was announced
in Windolf's handwritten minutes following a meeting of reconciliation
at Fassifern on 12 July 1882. There had also developed two churches at
Brisbane River (-on the river- and -in the scrub-) and these were
united in March 1884. Two months later, a motion at Marburg called for
the·unification of Brisbane River, Rosewood (Marburg), Mt Walker and
Falifern Assemblies! But even this was not to be, as further
difficulties resulted in divisions even in Marburg itself.
The Fassifern church and Pastor Windolf in 1887 exhorted the
members to reconciliation and to consider uniting with the English
Baptists. However, there was little progress.for it was reported that
there were two German groups at Marburg, three around Brisbane River
and also Mt Walker, but Engelsburg and Minden were in the English
Association.
A major reform of the German Conference must have taken place
around 1899 although the records are missing until 1890. But a meeting
at Engelsburg in October 1891 is referred to as the -third- such
meeting, and the number of churches.was now six. The next two years
were quite stable with five churches totalling over 400 members.
Blenheim came into the conference ·in 189S, but Engelsburg withdrew
again and the following year, 50 did Mt Walker. Records of some later
conferences have come to I1ght in recent tilles, enabling a further
docullentation of the life of the Conference.

The turn of the century meant a conference turning point as new
fellowship - Ha Ma Creek or Tent Hill - joined and new trained pastor
arrived from America, Rev. SJlluel Blum. The reform he brought about
led to a total revival in conference life, even drawing Engelsburg
back into the circle in a meeting in 1901. By then Minden had reached
SO members under a lay-leader A. Schmidt, Lowood/Fernvale had 80 under
W. LitzON and Marburg had 3S under W. Meissner.

An·, outward change in the conference was its new placing in the
year - generally at Easter time, and a new constitution was adopted.
(This can be found printed in the official history of Laidley Church.)
From 1902 to 1913, the venues rotated twice in this pattern:
Engelsbu~g, Blenheim, Minden, Marburg, Tenth!ll and Lowood.
Outstations included Kingaroy, Esk and Redland Bay. A copy of the
proceedings frolll 1904 was found in Hamburg 80 years later. It had been
called -Conference of Peace in the King's Vale-, opening at 7pm
Thursday 24 Harch, and containing four sessions. Reports showed that
they had 319 Sunday School children, S9 newly baptised believers and
total offerings had calle to 489 pounds. Topics discussed included the
keeping of the Sabbath, support for the Hayurbhanj Mis.ion in India
where ~liss Martha Huth served, and the distribution of Christian
tracts. On other occasions, they debated military service, involvement
in Government positions and the Christian attitude to dancing and
drinking. Discipline on church lIembers was usually quite strong.

Before the war broke out in 1914, the conference met at
Engelsburg, soon to have its name changed to Kalbar. By then, Lowood
had an outstation called Coal Creek with 92 members and Minden with
Kingaroy had 76. Marburg with its outstations reached 110.

By 1927, the Baptist Union of Queensland gave the statistics of
the German churches individually and not as a group which suggests
that the Conference had ceased to function by then, though some
evidence indicates that Tent Hill church belonged to it until 1930. As
late as 1932, the German language was still being used occassionally
in same churches. But it seems generally that the Conference declined
with the use of the language and thus this body became a thing of the
past, preserved mainly in docullents that have only partly been
translated and in the minds of its participants. As long as its
member remained ethnically isolated, it served its purpose well.

## A LIFE OF PASTOR HERMANN WINDOLF (1846-1922)

On 19 May, 1846 at the town of Gruneplan, Germany, an eleven day
old child, Friedrich Wilhelm Hermann was christened in the local
Lutheran church. He was the first child of his father, Friedrich
Wilhelm Conrad, a master mason, and his mother ~arie-Wilhelmine Agnes,
who was then 23 years of age. Four sisters and two brothers were to
follow. Some time later, their father swung over to the persuasion of
members of a new evangelical movement known as -Baptists.- But what
makes this 50 remarkable? This lad, known by his name Hermann, was to
be baptised by immersion at 16 years of age" by Pastor Kipperberg,
enter a missionary ~raining school In Hamburg three years later and
after being trained under the leader of the Baptists, Rev. J. G.
Oncken, ministered in his own country for over a decade before
migrating to remote mission field called Australia!

His first pastorate (1868-70) was at Herford, in Westphalia
where he held daily revival prayer meetings and baptised converts as
young as 10 and 13 years old. He was described as having -a quite meek
disposition, extending love to the poor and needy.- His pen was quite
active, with three sermon collections and some verse being produced
during this time. At Pastor Oncken's suggestion, he moved to
Braunschwieg (Brunswickl where he served for another nine years or so,
marrying in the meantime.

Due to pressures of life and war, many were migrating to freer
lands as assisted passengers and otherwise. The young pastor felt the
call to follow some of them to Australia in late 1877. He and his
wife, both aged 31 and two children, Frederich (3) and Hannah (1)
sailed from Hamburg via London, reaching Moreton Bay in nineteen
stormy weeks. They were classed as -free settlers-. Their arrival on
20 February, 1878 was joyously celebrated by the Baptist settlers.
Pastor Wind~lf is best left to describe the scene for himself:

-It was late summer, and the heat due to long absence of rain was
very burdensome on usl on the first night, which we spent with all the
others in the immigration quarters, a fearful storm broke. These are
heavier than those in Germany and have beneficial influence on the
climate and people's state of health. On the morning of the next day,
a friendly angel in the form of Brother Eder appeared to us, sent from
the 56-mile distant German brethren at Fassifern Scrub.

installed in his church, all began well with the local lay
leaders, brothers Kruger (Fassifern) and Peters (Mt Walker) laying
down their positions in favour of the new pastor. But by August,
disagreements had broken out between these men~ Consequently, the new
year saw Pastor Windolf installed in the -geographical centre- of the
mission field, Rosewood Scrub (Marburg).

Though the group there numbered 96 at that time, a year later 47
had been excluded and nine lost for other reasons. This indicated that
Pastor Windolf favoured a strong diSCipline, a fact which is endorsed
by entries in his own records. But he was also an energetic and
tireless worker. He wrote, -In the first quarter of 1879, I preached
the saving Word of God in 60 meetings, led 31 prayer meetings, gave a
funeral message, served four times at the breaking of bread, and made
70 home visits- (most which were done on horseback).

In spite of the sad break that had been made with the Fassifern
church, real times of revival were experienced at Marburg and
district. For example, Easter of 1881 in Tarampa Scrub's -Zoar- chapel'
saw a revival meeting following a love-feast which continued until
daybreak with 19 souls won to the Lord; 32 more were won. the next
Sunday following a public baptismal service.

However, strain and poor health got the better of Mr Windolf. In
July 1882, he negotiated peace with Fassifern on the understanding
that old issues be not raised again. He wrote at this time that ahe
would in no way let God's work suffer in favour of temporal things. On
the contrary, it was painful for him ••• due to his Buffering to give
up his position ••• (and) agreed that we should have another worker to
help in the great field of labour for both churches.- Pastor Windolf
agreed to write to Gernany for this help.

From this pOint on, his pastoral ministry recedes somewhat and
his writing ministry comes to the fore. His poems appeared in German
nagazines (e.g., one to accompany the obituary for J.G. Oncken in
1884) showing that his standing as a Christian poet was already
acknowledged at home. Three years later his. first printed anthology
appeared - -Thautropfen- (Due drops),. published in Bonn. Except for a
few references in the minutes of the German conference churches,
however, his name and his pen are silent for over a decade. But it is
evident that he pursued a ministry behind the scenes, being
particularly instrumental in calling further pastors to the work,
including M. Bernoth (188~) and S. Bluhm (1900). In 1901, a literary
surprise appeared in the form of a collection of J.G. Oncken's sermons
with notes taken down by Hermann and his uncle years before. It was
called -Licht und Recht- (Light and Justice) and was published by a
Baptist firm in Kassel after editing in Australia by Pastor Windolf.

But a revival in his ministry was soon to come. In 1905, he was
-festively re-installed· as pastor at Harburg, where membership was
81. During this second pastorate, he continued as a reporter for the
German Baptist papers and by 1908 had a new lease of life: another
anthology appeared (·Psalmen~lange·)1 he co.menced a series of
ministry trips to the Kingaroy area and celebrated 30 years ·of
ministry in Queensland. By then he was 62 years old.

At some stage he must have also studied homeopathic medicine, as
evidenced by reports in periodicals. Mechanical work and architecture
were also part of his activities, according to his grandson Henry, who
reports ~that books on these subjects were left from his grandfather's
library ~nd even contained same of his own designs!

In',1909, he resigned from Marburg and went to live with his son
near Engelsburg. There he continued writing and the next year law the
publication of two further anthologies, ·Sonnenstrahlen- and -Efeu und
HimmeI5schlu5sel.· In 1911, another one appeared, named ·Unter Maien
und Palmen.·· Despite a stroke in December 1911 and a fall from ,a
vehicl. in July 1912, Mr Windolf put out two more collections of poems
in 1913, ·Aus Hohen und Tiefen- and ·Heimatwarts·, the latter meaning
·Homewards.!' indicating that he was not looking forward to the heavenly
home. Both of these collections were acclaimed by the Governor of
Queensland and the chancellor of the UniverSity of Queensland. Mr
WindoU was by this time well known In Germany as a poet. His genius
even delved into horticulture and he became an honorary member of the
·Luther Burbank SOCiety· of California being an agent for their
material in Queensland.

By 1921, this productive writer had put out a selection of hymns
and poems for -recitation at all kinds of festive occasions.- But this
was to be his last work, for on 22 February 1922, his pen was stopped
for ever, following another stroke. He was survived by a wife and
three generations of descendants, but also by the fruit of his
ministry and his many literary jewels, many of which remain
untranslated. He was buried in a humble grave at the Kalbar public
ceaetery.
