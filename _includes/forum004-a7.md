## BDDK REVIEW

*The English Baptists of the 17th Century, by B.R. White.*\\
*(London, Baptist Historical Society, 1983)*
* 
This 138 page book by the principal of Regent's Park College,
Oxford uncovers a lot of new information about the very earliest days
of the Baptist denomination. For example, one of the two groups, the
General Baptists, taught that there were three orders of ministry -
the familiar deacons and pastors lor elders as they were usually
called) and 'messengers“ who had a wider ministry than the local
church and cohcentrated on church planting , but also exercised a
superintendency function and liased with other churches.

The General Baptist pastors were also involved in contacts
with other churches and seemed to have more independent influence than
those of Particular Baptists. But the churches of the latter group
were convinced from the earliest times of the necessity of fellowship
and mutual consultation on various issues between the churches. The
Associations which were formed as a result of this conviction were an
important part of the process of developing official statements of
faith for which the Particular Baptists were well known. Material on
the evolution of some of these documents is one of the most helpful
features of Dr Uhite's book.

Another interesting part of the book deals with some of the
early evangelists. They were quite notorious for their ”lively and
chaotic' meetings which attracted quite a few members of “other more
staid congregations' to share the 'excitement of the preaching and
doctrinal debates.' Dne novel procedure which might not be worth
copying these days was to have several speakers on the platform and to
let the congregation ”shout out their preferences among the preachers
on offer'! Questions and interjections were permitted during and
after the sermons.

The 17th Century was a time of great social and political
turmoil in England and many Baptists were in the thick of it. Dr white
portrays these difficult days clearly, with ample quotations from
contemporary documents. There is a great deal of similarity with
conditions in parts of the modern world and it is instructive to see
how our Baptist forefathers coped with the difficult problems such as
attitudes towards state authorities, the established Church and
doctrinal controversy. Often times the sacrifice for loyalty to the
gospel was costly in the extreme.

The book is divided into separate chapters on the General
Baptists and the Particular Baptists up to the decisive events of the
year 1660 when the English monarchy was restored after the Revolution
and the Cromwellian Protectorate. This ushered in a period of great
persecution until 1688 during which Baptists and other dissenters
suffered under repressive legislation which denied them many civil and
religious rights. The final chapter of the book deals with this
difficult period. Unite also has some useful material in the opening
chapter on the nature of Baptist history which will interest all
students of the subject, as will other sections which give sketches of
prominent leaders and the gradual emergence of recognizable
denominational structures and procedures.

All in all, this is a worthy volume to initiate a new series
on Baptists in each of the early centuries edited by the author. It is
anticipated that other volumes will also follow the pattern of this
first one by taking a fresh approach rather than staying within the
tradition of existing histories and by working with original and in
many cases, previously unpublished sources. The review copy, was made
available by the Baptist Foundation of N.S.W.
