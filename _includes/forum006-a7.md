## Forthcoming Annniversaries

The Society now has basic details about all the churches of the Baptist
Union of Queensland on a computerised data-base 50 it is easy to find
which churches are due for anniversaries. Mr Graham Hobbs is to be
thanked for the laborious work of locating and entering the data.
Churches with anniversaries of date of constitution are as follows:


### 100 years:
- Rosewood/Lanefield commenced 1871
- Sandgate  1870
### 75 years

## 1987 PROGRAHME

At the Annual Meeting (see page 1 for details) it is planned to discuss
activities for 1987 â€¢.. Contributions to this discussion are welco1lled.
The Society is looking for .interested members (and others -. potential
members?) to be 'willing to present ideas about ways their own
historical interests can be incorporated in the overall programme.

If you are working on a historical survey of your church, or if you are
writing a biography of a well known church leader, why not be prepared
to offer this as a possibility for a BHSQ meeting.

One strong possibility for early in 1987 is a feature based on HI"
Graham Hobbs' work on Baptist Church buildings in Queensland. He has
assembled a great deal of material which is of interest to Society
members and to pastors and building committees. Watch for details.
