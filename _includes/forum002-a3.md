## JOHN WHITE WRITES AGAIN

Our "official" Baptist historian, Rev. John White M.A.,
has served the denomination further into his debt, adding 
one more item to his long list of valuable services to the 
denomination. This time the 125 year history of Ipswich 
Church whichÂ·he served as pastor for 24 years. Attractively
produced, with some original art work by C.E. Colran and
The Golden Imprinter of Milton, this 114 page volume
competently covers the church's story up to the present.
As a bonus, the author deals with a number of interest
related issues, such as early life in the city, and the
outreach of the church and its association with other 
Christian activities in the area.

Ever one to throw out a stimulating challenge, Mr, 
White has come up with novel claim for his church - that
it was the first Baptist Church in Queensland. Before
rushing off to the history books (probably written by
Mr. White too!) to check this audacious claim, remember
"Queensland" did not officially exist as a separate identity 
with that name until 6th June 1859, when Queen Victoria
signed the official documents authorising the move. 
Initial development of what was to become the Ipswich
Baptist Church took place on June 23 and 25l Official
separation of Queensland took place on December 10 1859 
and in the next month, the church was officially formed!

Mr. White's book is available for $5. plus $1. postage
