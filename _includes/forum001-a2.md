## Why Write Your Church's History?

- by Rev.·Dr. David Parker

Most churches try to publish some kind of historical record at
their jubilee or_centenary. The Union archives contain many that
have been produced. What then is the reason for this common desire
to put the church's story in print?

We can start with the simplest reason of all — because the church
is there and it seems as if it is necessary to tell its story at
a major milestone in its life. It is the same as the reason they
give for climbing Mt. Everest - it's there, that's all! Or to
put it the other way around, the author of the history gets the
conviction that it must be written, and so the process begins.

A second reason is that the task is assigned by the theological
college or by the church. It is good to encourage the writing of
church histories for this reason. Sometimes it might be the only
way they would get written! Undoubtedly some worthwhile work has
been done`in this way. The college library has a growing collection
of graduate theses on historical topics which will prove to be use-
ful foundations for more important work in the future.

Another reason for writing church histories is that they are part
of a larger project, like a family or suburban history. In this
way, the history takes on interesting significance as its relationship 
with other bodies is clearly established.

Perhaps a more purposeful reason is to tell the story of the church
for a wider readership, or for posterity. The church's story may
be particularly significant or there may be good reasons for wanting 
people to know about it. If well written, a church history is
of great value because it_is a local history and can give more
attention to social and personal details than s denominational
history.

A fifth reason—to clarify the ‘sinews' of the church's essential
dynamics. Leaders of churches need to know where the church has
come from and what makes it the way it is, otherwise they may not
be able to lead it effectively. Some leaders either knew this
from personal experience or manage to sense it subconsciously, but
most will need to discover lt. Preparation of a history.B an
excellent means to acquire this and so is virtually a necessity.

Closely related to the need for clarification of the church's
dynamics is the need for members to be educated and informed about
the church's·l1fe. If they are going to participate in its affairs,
they too will need to appreciate its character. Publication of the
history in an attractive form will help them to gain this under-
standing and will enable them to contribute effectively to its
continuing programme and objectives.

The seventh reason for the preparation of a church's history is
the most important of all. It is a testimony to God's grace!
After all, as the apostle Paul,made clear, we and our churches
are like clay pots carrying the precious treasure of the gospel
so that God might receive the glory (2 Cor. Q:7). Despite us,
His gospel is still powerful; His love can still be seen in us!

So writing a church history is an important task indeed,
with wide implications. It demands excellent work and
work of a certain type if lt is to achieve its desired 
objective. It needs to be comprehensive, accurate,
attractive, analytical and personalised. Above all else,
lt should show the power and relevance of the gospel and
so be a stirring testimony to God.
