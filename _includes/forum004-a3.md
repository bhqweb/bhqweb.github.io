## From presentation by Rev. Peter Van Donge on Eric Stanley Jones

Eric S. Jones, FCIS, AASA, FISM, was leading and highly 
influential figure amongst Baptists in Oueensland for half a century
up until his death on 23 September, 1973. He also made an important
contribution to his employers, Nest1e’s, whom he served as a clerk and
then as Accountant from the time when he began work on 10/- a week in
January 1916 till his retirement in December 1965.

Eric Jones was born at the family home at Kangaroo Poing
Brisbane on 7 April, 1901 and was educated locally. He studied briefly
at the Central Technical College before taking up his employment with
Nestle’s, a company which had only established itself in Australia in
1905. In that same year, it opened its first Ouensland branch with a
factory at Toogoolawah. Being a progressive company, Nestle’s soon
began to expand and Eric Jones shared in its prosperity by sucessive
promotions until his appointment to management as Accountant in 1934
He did not seem to seek promotion beyond this as it would mean leaving
Queensland unless he were to move into the sales area. He undertook
further study in accountancy and gained membership in several
important Associations. Upon a company restructuring, he was made
Assistant Manager in 1961. He was widely respected by his efficiency,
hard work and personal example. Even after his retirement, he was
invited by the company to assist in consultancy and advisory work.

During his youth, the Jones family moved to the Annerley area
where they became fully involved with the Fairfield (now Annerleyl
Baptist Church which was located near the railway station. lt was an
outreach of the Vulture St (South Brisbane) church, and its pastor was
Rev. R. Horn. The family later moved to Salisbury to live and cut ·
their connection with the Fairfield church, but Eric commuted each
Sunday to maintain his links.

As well as being fully involved in the Sunday School, the Young
Pe¤ple's Society of Christian Endeavour and the Band of Hope, Eric
took up his first office on the church‘s Mission Board in 1918. Soon
after, when the pastoral situation was difficult, he undertook studies
at the Queensland Baptist College with a view to joining the ministry.
Lectures were held in the evenings, and Eric attended for three years
before concluding that he had no call to the full-time ministry. He
was frequently in the pulpit over succeeding years so his training was
put to good effect.

The church soon saw his qualities and made him a deacon in 1922
an office which he held for 51 years. At was during this time that he
formed a close and helpful association with the pastor, Rev. Ralph
Sayce, later Baptist Union secretary.

Eric married Ruby Matthews on 1O May 1924, a musically talented
office worker who attended his church. They settled at Gilmore SL
Ekibin and continued to worship at Annerley. There were four children: `
Keith, Mavis, Esme and Stan. Ruby pre-deceased Eric on 21 October
1970 from a stroke. Eric was a devoted family man, despite the busy
life he lived, setting a strong lead in the home. He was well known in
the local community for his loving interest and responsible
involvement.

In the year of his marriage, he was appointed secretary of the
Annerley church. Although only young, he soon proved his ability in '
this work as well as in his employment with Nestle’s. He set a
vigorous lead in developing the church's work amongst youth and
children and outreach into the community. By 1931 he was also caring
for the ·church’s books. The location of the church had become
, ` untenable by this time, and Eric, along with others, worked hard to
l re-site it to its present location in Annerley Road. This was completed
T early in 1935. He compiled a history of the church for the occasion.

1 ln 1939 he took over leadership of the Sunday School, retaining
1 the position of superintendent until 1952; he was in the position
T again briefly 1954-6. The war created problems for the church with a
I loss of workers and ultimately; even the pastor was called up for
` chaplaincy service. This threw heavier responsibility onto Mr Jones
, and the other deacons. Eric was frequently involved in preaching and
‘ other pastoral duties. In particular, he was diligent in his concern
\ for church members on active duty and wrote lengthy letters to them
; all, a practice he also maintained for his Nestle's employees in a
l similar position.

Post—war development in the area saw the church branch out
i to establish new centres at Fairfield, Tarragindi and Salisbury. Eric
, Jones was in the forefront of these moves and took more than his fair
~ share of the load. But there was a cost involved, because it meant
` depletion of the home church’s reserves and many growing pains.
Ultimately, it seemed advisable for Nr Jones to step down from some of
` his onerous duties and make way for others. His role at the church
l changed into a more supportive one, although he exercised a direct and
j active ministry as leader of the Adult Sunday School Department for 14
years, where he made an invaluable contribution to the lives of these
i more senior class members.

His main area of ministry during these years was increasingly
with the denominational administration. He had been active in youth
work since before the war. For example, he participated in the
inspection of the site of the Currumbin Youth Camp with its original
owner, Ken Lethem, who later made it available to the Baptist Uniom
Mr Jones served on the Sunday School Committee from 1939 and was
treasurer until 1950. He saw the development of youth and children's
work in association with two other highly influential laymen, Roy
Lockhart and Monty Jones. Two important developments were the
appointment of Rev. John Knights as the first director and the
creation of the Baptist Book Store as a resource centre for the
denomination. In addition, Mr Jones worked tirelessly in the various
programmes such as Sunday School demonstrations and Scripture exams.
But when this work seemed to be progressing well, Nr Jones turned
to the area of financial administration. He was appointed General
Treasurer in 194é, succeeding Mr A.E. Bickmore in the post. His most
important contribution was in the creation of a Budget System but it
took ten years of labour and then another thirteen before a fully
subscribed budget was possible. He was also involved in moves for
improvements in pastoral stipends, care for senior and retired pastors
and the general administration of Union finances. As part of this
work, he participated in major Union developments such as the
acquisition of Baptist House in Ann St, 'Resthaven' aged persons' home
at Brookfield and the re-location of the Baptist College. His
contributions were always characterised by wisdom, understanding, a
grasp of detail. His labour was honoured by appointment to the
_denomination’s highest office, the presidency, in 1958, and the
granting of Life Membership of the Union upon his retirement in 1972.

Tributes offered on that occasion showed the great esteem in
which he was held. It seemed fitting that when his homecall came, H
took place in the middle of the Baptist Assembly. His successor as
treasurer had presented his first report earlier in the proceedings
and his son in law had been appointed to a Union position. But on the
Sunday evening, he took sick at his home and died later in hospital
Assembly arrangements were interrupted on the following Tuesday for
_the funeral which was held from his home church. Whatever flaws or
shortcomings there may have been in his busy life, they were those of
' a zealous man determined to manage his affairs as a faithful steward
r of Jesus Christ.
