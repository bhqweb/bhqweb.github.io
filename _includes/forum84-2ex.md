## Two New Publications Launched

Two new publications have been launched by the Baptist Heritage Queensland – both updates of earlier works.

Baptists in Queensland is an information book about the practical aspects, beliefs and history of Baptists in Queensland, and was the first book ever published by BHSQ when it appeared in 1994. It sold very well, with some reprints necessary and a second edition in 2000. It was therefore long overdue for an update, especially on account of the many changes that have taken place in the 12 years since the ‘millennium edition’ was produced.

It is still the same size at 52 pages but now has a full colour cover featuring 4 Queensland churches. It has been extensively revised with new material (including a section on Baptists and Marriage) and changes to reflect the current state of affairs. Statistics have been updated in the light of the recent census. The book retains it original aim as an introduction to Baptist life locally here in Queensland for new and existing members, students and enquirers. This revision was largely funded by Queensland Baptists who will distribute copies amongst the churches. Additional copies from BHQ cost $5 plus $2.50 p & p.

The other book is The National Guide to Australian Baptist Historical Resources and Services which includes information from every state and the national Baptist bodies about their records, with contact details of archives and libraries from which more information may be obtained. It also contains a list of Baptist periodicals in Australian libraries. It has information about Baptist logos and advice about the nature and use of Baptist records.

This 40 page book, which is a ‘print on demand’ publication, also has a companion website with additional material. The publication is designed for students and others wanting to know where to find sources of information about Baptists in Australia. The help of Archivists and others in all states of Australia, Australian Baptist Ministries and Global Interaction is acknowledged in the compiling of this resource book. Copies are available from BHQ or the Archives at a special introductory price of $5.00 plus $2.50 p & p.
