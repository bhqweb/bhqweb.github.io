## History of the Senior Girls Missionary Union Published

The history of the Senior Girls Missionary Union (SGMU), has been written by Bill Hughes with the support of a number of former “senior girls”, has now been released, and is available for sale.
The SGMU was a highly successful and hardworking organisation which provided financial, personal and spiritual support for overseas missionaries following its establishment in Queensland in 1924. In its earlier years the SGMU mainly supported women missionaries in India and Bangladesh, but it later expanded its work to cover other parts of the world as well.

The history covers the establishment of the SGMU, the nature of its work, the contribution of women to the work of the overseas missions and the type of missionary work that the organisation supported. A number of attachments list the main office holders of the SGMU Central Executive, SGMU membership statistics, year by year funds raised by the SGMU and the names of Queensland missionaries who served in India from 1855 to 1966

In its heyday the SGMU was supported by women at a time when many were homemakers and were not bound by involvement in paid employment. As more and more women moved into the paid workforce the numbers available for this type of missionary support work diminished and other ways of supporting missions were developed. But the work of the SGMU was quite remarkable and the history of this fairly unique organisation is well worth recording.

Copies of the history are available at a cost of $10 (plus postage where applicable) and may be obtained from Bill Hughes (07-3256 8897 or 0409 915 685) or by contacting the Queensland Baptist Archives by email at archives@qb.com.au

This is just one of a number of monographs that Bill Hughes has produced. Others include “A History of the Biloela District Baptist Church”, “A History of the Gladstone Baptist Church, 1966-2011”, “The Deagon Baptist Mission”, and Gracemere Baptist Fellowship, 1991-2011”. He also wrote the centennial history of the Warwick Baptist Church which was published in 2011.

The histories of Biloela, Gladstone and Gracemere were produced as part of the Central Queensland project, for which Bill also wrote the history of Mount Morgan church (this is being revised with additional information which has recently become available). These are all available on a print-on-demand basis.
