## Denominational Archives given Official Foundation

The 2012 Queensland Baptist Assembly gave official recognition to the Baptist Church Archives Qld by adding a specific section to the Constitution & By-Laws. The section, No 25, is headed, ‘Recognition of Role and Work of the Archivist’ and begins, ‘The Baptist Union shall establish and maintain an Archives for the collection, preservation and management of its physical and electronic records.’ which shall be ‘under the control of an Archivist appointed by the Board.’ It goes on to specify that ‘All sections of the Baptist Union, including Board, ASG, Charter Groups Service Groups, Ministry organisations, and officers, shall keep formal records of their activities, and these records shall be transferred regularly to the Archives, or be cared for in a similar manner by the originating organisation.’

The new article explains that ‘Records housed in the Archives shall be subject to rules of access with the purpose of maximising their preservation and facilitating their use by bona fide researchers.’ and that ‘Records of member churches, organisations and individuals related to the denomination and to Baptist work generally may also be accepted by the Archives.’ In the case of churches that cease to function, the new By-Law states that ‘The Baptist Union shall encourage [them] to transfer all records to the Archives.’

These new provisions were introduced in consultation with the Archives and it is hoped that they will not only put the denominational Archives on a firm footing, but also serve to encourage local churches to care for their records properly as well.
