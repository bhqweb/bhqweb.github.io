## PROGRESS! AND POTENTIAL

Welcome to the second issue of the Newsletter of the
Baptist Historical Society of Queensland. The BHSQ
enters 1985 with an interesting programme of activities
in process of deve1opment...see back page of this Newsletter
for details. If the initial three meetings of 1984 are any
guide, the Society can expect to contact a wide range of
interested people throughout the year. This is most encouraging. 
But what will be needed beyond this is a
greater consolidation of its activities and work.

There is ample evidence of a growing interest in 
historical matters and of a deepening appreciation of
their importance for the present and future life of the
denomination. A Historical Society is an ideal agency
to foster and harness this interest and to channel it into
productive areas. The Bi—Centenary of Australia to be
celebrated in 1988 is providing a welcome stimulus for
historical thinking and imaginative celebration. Our
sister organisation in N.S.W. has caught the vision of
what can be achieved. See inside for information about
their plans. It would be good if Queensland could play
a major part in the ambitious project they have commenced.

What we are aiming for is the development of a
significant group of Baptists who are deeply committed to
an informed interest in historical matters. If this
interest can be coeordinated through the BHSQ, then there
is every hope that there will be a good deal of creative
research, careful preservation of records and useful
guidance from our rich »eritage. This can only enhance
the quality of Baptist witness in Queensland and ‘
stabilise its growth.

So we appeal to the present members and friends of
the Society to do all they can to advance this aim. Your 
contribution to the life of the BHSQ is important!
