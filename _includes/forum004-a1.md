## News and Notes

Thanks to all those who have responded to our recent circular which gave an up-date on developments in the work of the Baptist Historical Society of Queensland during the latter part of last yeam Us have received some subscriptions, which means we can still continue
to function, but more are needed. lf you intend to send yours in, may
a we invite you to do so right away?

The programme as indicated elsewhere in this newsletter is not
as extensive as it could be, but it should prove effective in its own
way. Organised activities of the Society are entirely dependant on the
support they receive from members and friends. If you know of
suitable projects, please let us know so that we can include them in
our planning.

By now there are Historical Societies operating in several
other states. The BHSQ receives the regular newsletter of the NSU
society. Some jottings from that publication are included in this
edition for members' interest.

Finally, lt would be good to mount a display at the 1986
Baptist Union assembly. This is a useful way of bringing the Society
to the attention of people. There is plenty of historical interest in
the churches if the occasional comments of people are any guide. If
youtca: help in planning, sitting up and covering the display, please
contact us as soon as possible.
