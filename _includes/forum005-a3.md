## THE CHURCHES OF THE GERMAN BAPTIST CONFERENCE THE BEGINNINGS

There were no lIinisters to labour among the German migrants of
the 1860s., but the faithful tesUmony of lay lien led to lIany
conversions and baptisms, and to the formation of the churches at
Z11lman's Waterholes (now Zililiere) and Logan. Support also came from
some of the original German missionaries involved in the' Gassner
Mission's work at Zion's Hill, Nundah (German Station). These churches
beca~e extinct as people lIoved away from these areas to the scrub
districts beyond Ipswich and on the Brisbane River which were then
opening up for settlellent.

Baptists may have been in present in the early 1860s at Normanby
Relerve in the Harrisville/Mutdapilly area. Under the leadership of Mr
Schneider, their witness had become quite strong by 1867 and in 1871,
a church was constituted. Previous to thiS, links were maintained with
the Ipswich Church which was the centre for the fir!lt Baptist
Association in Queen!lland, formed in 1870. Some of the !lettlers had
~oved further on to !lettle in the Coleyville Gap/Mt Walker area where
a building was erected in 1868. This was !loon to be the main centre
until the work at Engelsburg (Kalbar) took the lead after 187S. But by
1886, Mt Walker was being supplied by Kalbar, a task taken over by
Boonah in 1921, and the work clo!led down in 1967, jU!lt one hundred
years .fter the first witness began.

Meanwhile, others had. turned north and founded a church in the
Fernvale/Vernor district on the Brisbane River, near Lowood in 1869.
H. Falkenhager who had been a leader of work at Zillmere and Logan wal
set apart by the Ipswich Church in 1871 to lead this ministry. It was
relocated south of Lowood in the 1890s and then to Taraapa in 1926.
In 1870, these three fellowships allounted to about IS0 members. In
1874, the German churches had formed their own conference. Another
thriving church was also formed at Marburg (or Rosewood Scrub' in
1871, but the witness which began at the salle time on the south side
of the scrup at Lanefield and later relloved to the town of Rosewood
was not of German origin. 'Membership of the.German churches in 1905
was around 55O.

### MARBURG

The church at Marburg waB established in 1871 and was led by C.
Dahn, C. Lamprecht and C. Arndt. At first, it sought affiliation with
Mt Walker, but in 187S it transferred it links to the Brisbane River
church to the north, with the approval of· the German Baptist
Conference. Membership which began at 14 climbed to 113 by 1877,
helped along by the transfer of 19 members from Zillman's Waterhdle
assembly near Brisbane. Aha, during this tille, several families from
Minden Here associated with the Marburg church, prior to the
establishment of their aNn fellowship. In 1879, Pastor HermanoWindolf,
lately arrived from Germany, took pastoral charge of the tHO
felloHships, . as well as servjng elsewhere as Hell. When his health
failed, Pastor M. Bernath arrived from Germany in 188S to take
leadership. His ministry was short, and he was succeeded by various
lay men. Serious divisions plagued the church, to the extent even of
the erection of a second building in the town, and links being set up
with Ipswich.

The church' joined with Lowood (Brisbane River', Minden and
Blenheim in 1900 to call Rev. S. BlulI, but ill-health cut his ministry
short. Pastor Windolf returned in 1904 to lead the church until 1909.
His successor, Pastor Imke was unable to find a house at Marburg, 50
arrangements were made for him to live in the vacant Minden manse,
although a joint pastoral arrangement (to include Lo~ood as Hell» was
rejected as unworkable. After 1914, Marburg chur~~' was linked in a
joint 'pastorate with Lanefield (now Rosewood' church to the south
under English pastors arranged through the Baptist Union of
Queensland·. In this Nay the Marburg church came under strong English
influence from a comparatively early date, but it still retained its
contacts with the Gerllan churches.

### MINDEN

Baptist work first began in the Minden area, north-west of
Ipswich in the late 18705. Prior to this, Baptist families travelled
down to Marburg (or RoseNood Scrub, as the area was then known' where
a church had been established as early as 1871. But in 1884 a church
fellowship was established at Minden and a year later Mr Wilhelm
Truloff donated an acre of land for a building and a cemetery. The
church was opened in May Hith a large celebration Hhich was customary,
including a -love feast- and a long revival lIeeting. The building has
been renovated and modified over the years from 1907 until 1960 and a
hall was erected in 1969.

No full-time pastor Has appointed for some time, but Mr J.
Schultz and August SC~lIidt Here devoted lay-preachers and leaders.
From quite early tilles, the church partiCipated in the German
Conference, Hhose meetings Here occaSionally held at Minden. However,
in 1900, Minden in partnership with Lowood, Marburg and Blenheim
churches called Pastor S. Blum from USA. A manse was built at Minden
(the present building renovated) and the new pastor preached Heek
about at the four churches. Later Tent Hill also joined the group. His
ministry Has greatly appreciated.

After Pastor Blum's departure due to ill-health in 1903, the
church was served by pastors of other German churches. From 1903,
Minden and Lowood worked together under the leadership of Pastor Franz
Orthner, also of USA. (Removal expenses were 35 pounds and the annual
stipend 110 pounds!) When he resigned in 1910 after the sad death of
his yaung wife (daughter of a local family) and baby, the treasurer
also resigned because-he said that th_re was no Hark for him to do nOH
that there was no stipend to pay!

The church was without a full-time pastor again until 1919. By
then some English services had been introduced and an approach was
made to the Baptist Union for help in securing a pastor. Rev. C.
CrDnau was the first English pastor, again in a sharing arrangement
with LOHDOd. Membership at this time was around 80. A long line of
diltinguished ministers served the two churches ,until in 19~8 Marburg
also joined in the group. In 1982", the Tarampa Church (Lowood had
moved there in 1926) left the group to Hark entirely independently.

### KALBAR (ENGELSBURG) AND BOONAH

When the German Baptist Church which had been established at Mt
Walker/Coleyville in 1867 agr,ed to the farmation'of a neH fellowship
a.t Engel!5burg (officially known as Kalbar from 1963) in 187~, it Has
making an historic move. The new church, Hhich dates its independence
from 22 August of that year, soon took over frail the pioneer
fellowship as the centre of Baptist Hitness in the area.

The leader of the new work was Mr J. Stibbe and before long, the
first of many baptismal services was being held. Some of these
, services saw the baptism of scares of candidate.. The first building
Has erected in 1877 Hhen the mellbership was 32. Thls church Has
replaced in 1882 and enlarged in 1891. Another church Has erected on a
neH site in 1907 which in turn Has enlarged at various times. A
co.pletely new modern building Has erected in 1965. Maximull membership
Has 292 in 1936.

in 1877, Pastor Carl Krueger was appointed leader but he stepped
aside a few months later to make way for Pastor H.' Windolf Hho Has
joint pas.tor of Engelsburg and tit Walker. But a short time later,
Pastor Windolf moved to Marburg and Pastor Krueger took up the Hark
a.gain in 1886, remaining in office until 1918. Pastor Windolf later
returned to be his assistant during some of this time.

Engel!5burg became a member of the Baptist Association (Union) in
1894, but withdreH in 1899 until taking up membership again in 1918
Hhen it had an English pastor for the first tille and many of its
distinctive German features were beginning to be less noticeable. Most
obvious of all was the use of the English language in services.

There were several outstations, some of them quite flourishing
causes, at various times: Silo .. (1896-19~1)' CharlHaod (1908- )'
Aratula (1922-1972), Roadvale (1947-1973) and WarrillVi_w (1946-196~).
Bocnah Church which Has established by Engelsburg in 1887 (first at
nearby Dugandan) became a strong independent church, but it is now
linked with Kalbar again.

### LAIDLEY (BLENHEIM)

Baptist work in this area began when the Hermann Jackw!tz,
Carl Mutzleburg and F. Kerwitz and their families arrived at Sandy
Creek or Blenheim in 1882-84 and Horshipped in each others homes.
Other fallilies from nearby areas soon joined them to create a strong
Baptist community. They Here in membership Hith the churches at LaHood
or Marburg, whose pastors visited periodically for the ministry of the
Word. In time, a permanent link was estalished with LaHood as a branch
church. Meetings were also held at Deep Bully and Laidley Creek, and a
visit would be made occasionally to LaHood itself for worship,
especial 1 y for the cOllllunion services.

With groHth in numbers, a building Has necessary. So in 1892,
there took place the opening and dedication a' a church on a site
donated by Mr Jack"!tz. It was burned to the ground in 1899 and
another building was, erected elsewhere, which Has enlarged and
renovated at various tilles in later years.

In 189~, an approach was made to the German Conference for
recognition of the felloHship as an independent church. Foundation
membership was 48 with Carl Mutzelburg as leader. He carried out an
ext&nsive and fruitful pastoral ministry in addition to his farlling
for several years until Rev. S. Blum Has called from USA in 1900.

He served the churches of Lowood, Minden, and Marburg as Hell as
Blenheim. He also began Hark in the Ma Ma Creek area Hhich resulted in
the establishment of an independent church at Tent Hill in 1901. The
branches at Deep Gully and Lef~ Hand Branch transferred from Blenheim
to the neH Hark, but the Hatton Vale felloHship transferred frail
Minden to Blenheim at about the siUlle tiae. Blenheim and Tent Hill
churches nOH combined together to call Rev. O. E. Kruger from USA. He
arrived in December 1901, serving until 1908, being succeeded by Rev.
J. 'Heinrich (also of USA) whose ministry spanned the period up to
1931.

Although the members Here mostly of German background, in 1907
two 'English' people, William and Lucinda Dart Here baptised. Later
several members of the Dart fallily entered the Baptist ministry.
(Others who entered the ministry from this church Here Rev. E.V.
Keith and Rev. G. LitzoN.) Occasional English services were held frail
1916 and German services were discontinued officially in 1930. In the
same year, the church terminated its membership in the German
Conference and became a lIember of the Baptist Union. The first English
pastor, Re~. W.K. Holmans was appointed in 1931, alaost ~O years after
the co.mencellent of witness in the district.

The link Nith Tent Hill was severed in 193~ when a new Nark
commenced in Gatton demanded the pastor's attention. Blenheim
continued under the leadership of Rev. S. NeNe11 (193~-47). His
successor, Pastor A. LaN, pioneered services in the tONn of Laidley
(1948 onNards) where the response led to the purchase of land.
Although a move to transfer the work to Laidley in 19~1 did nat
lIaterialize, under the leadership of Rev. D. A. Dunlop, in 19~2 a hall
was erected in Nhich to conduct regular evening services. Eventually,
in January 1954, the decision Nas made to relocate. The last service
Has held in Blenheim on January 24, and in September of that year, the
present church in Laidley was opened. Extensive developments have
taken place since under the continuing ministry of Mr Dunlop,
including the establishment of an aged persons home in 1968.

### TENT HILL

Nestling up close to the valleys and spurs of the Great Divide,
Tent Hill church had a pre-history of tNenty years until it was
officially, constituted on 3 Septeaber 1901 in an impressive service
attended by representatives of the five other German Conference
churches. Its first building was erected a year later and it lasted
until 19:51 when a new one was erected which was rellodelied in , 1977.
Growth was quick - from a foundation meabership of :5:5, it had risen to
126 on its third anniversary.

But the early years were tough yet satisfying as the settlers
carved out an existence in the scrubs ,of Deep Gully, Left Hand Branch,
Mt Sylvia and Ma Ma Creek. At the same time, they were faithful in
their witness and fellowship travelling miles in difficult
circumstances for worship and evangelisa.

Pastoral oversight Has provided by Pastor S. Blum who had come
from USA to serve some of the other Ger.an churches (Blenheim, Lowood,
Minden and Marburg). When Tent Hill was constituted, Pastor Otto
Krueger was called from USA and took up his work as joint pastor of
Tent Hill and Blenheim (where he lived) in 1902. He was succeeded in
1908 by another American German, Pastor J. Heinrich. It was not until
the end of his ministry in 1930 that the first Queensland trained,
English pastor was apPOinted in the person of Rev. W.K. Holmans. By
this time, English had been in use for, almost 1:5 years. In 1930, the
church joined the Baptist Union of Queensland.

An important outreach ,pf the church under' the leadership of
Pastor Holmans was the establishllent in 1935 of work in Gatton. So
fruitful was this ministry that Mr Holmans became joint pastor of Tent
Hill-Gatton, leaving Blenheim to call its own pastor. (The work was
transferred to La.idley in 1954.) A similar move took place in 1978
when the:Gatton Church asked for the join pastorate with Tent Hill .to
be terminated, both churches becoming independent. Tent Hill purchased
a manse i at the nearby town of Grantham, and found new avenues of
service in the farming areas to the west and south.
