## WIDER CONTACTS

Some material from this BHSQ Newsletter has found its way into
interesting places. The newsletter of the Church Archivists' Society,
based in Toowoomba, and with an Australian-wide circulation, reprints
some of our material occasionally.

But recently two letters have come from overseas indicating a wider
interest in our activi ties. One came from The Historical Comm:ission of
the Southern Baptist Convention. So now our newsletter will be sent to
them as well.

The second letter was from the archivist of the North American Baptist
Seminary, South Dakota, which was previously located in Rochester, New
York. This was the seminary from which some of the early German pastors
graduated. Having heard of our German Baptist celebration, the
archivist is wanting further information to add to their own records in
the hope of bringing material about their graduates up to date.

In fact, the archivist wrote, "I recall visiting with Rev. Franz
Orthner in the '305, telling me of his pastorate of the German-speaking
Baptist churches in Minden and Lowood, Queensland, Australia."

It is to be hoped that this contact will allow us here 1n Queensland
also to fill in some details of the five American German pastors who
contributed 50 much to an important segment of our early life.
