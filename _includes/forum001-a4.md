## Printing and Publishing Your Church History
- by Rev. John Ward,\\
 sub-Editor of "The Queensland Baptist"
 
### Introduction:

By publishing, we mean the accepting of financial responsibility
for the editing, typesetting, printing and marketing or a
literary work considered meritorious and saleable. The publisher 
may carry out all these operations himself if he has
the facilities, or he may contract out any or all of them.
Whichever he chooses, he retains control of the total process.
Thus, the author becomes the client who sells his/her interest
in the literary work to the publisher for a lump sum or for
a royalty on each copy sold, or some combination of both.

When a person or group simply presents a typescript, to a
printer to be printed for him/her/it, that person or group
becomes the publisher and finances the entire operation.
The printer may advise but the client retains control. This
is the usual situation for the production of a local church
history.

### Preparation:

Let us suppose you have written your church history. Now you 
want it printed. A general rule is that the easier you make
it for the printer to typeset, the less expensive the job
will be. This usually means that the script should be type
written, double-spaced with a 4cm margin down the left side.

Editing should have been done before presentation for quotation
and eventual printing. Editing ensures correction of typing
and grammatical errors, consistency of style and checking for
possible legal infringements. A working journalist is the best
person to carry out this task, but you can certainly do it yourself 
if you are prepared to learn the procedure.

The copy should be complete when presented to the printer, if
further copy is presented after typesetting has begun, a further
cost will usually be incurred.

By all means ask for a quotation or estimate of cost. This 
will usually be given free of charge and obligation, provided
the work is presented complete at the time, including all art
work, photographs, maps, and such details as page size, number
of copies required, type of paper, type size for the text, kind 
of cover and binding are settled with your printer before the 
quotation starts.

Most printing offices have preferred sizes of page size that
best suit their printing presses, e.g. 5 x 8 inches or 180 x 240 mm. 
If you want a different style of book, be sure your printer
knows this before work begins.

### Methods of Printing:

Two main processes are used in the commercial industry.

**Letterpress** is the process using characters of type assembled
by hand or machine, and transferring an inked image direct
to the paper. This was the original process invented by
Gutenburg.

**Lithography** or the Offset process utilises the principle that
oil and water do not mix. Ink is an oil-based substance.
Lithography uses a plate composed of oily sections representing
the images to be printed; and non-oily damp sections. Ink ad-
heres to the former, but not to the latter. The image is transferred 
to the paper by means of rollers, hence the term "offset".

Letterpress is still widely used for wedding stationery, docket
and receipt books, business cards and short-run work, but is
relatively expensive when half-tone blocks of pictures, and other
sorts of art work are to be used.

Lithography is usually faster on the machine, especially on
long-run jobs, and lends itself admirably to the relatively
cheap use of halftones and other art work. The Baptist Print
Shop produces work by the offset process.

### Proofs And Checks:

As typesetting proceeds, you may be called upon to have the 
setting proof-read. This is your opportunity to check the
work as it comes from the composing room. You will be expected 
to make any corrections of spelling, omissions or additions,
or other mistakes. If you wish to make any new additions or
deletions at this stage, again you will usually incur
additional cost. However, if these absolutely must be made,
now is your last chance to do them!

When all proofshave been read and the marked corrections
made, your printer will go ahead on the makeup of the pages `
in the correct order. You can arrange for the opportunity
to check this final imposition, ensuring that all is as
specified, before the.job goes to press. Now is also the
time to check about the type of binding, e.g. whether side-
stitch or saddlestitch (or some other) as this will determine
the size of the margins that are required between the pages.
Some suggestions for a better-looking result — do not try
to cram too much on the page. This means choice of an easily
readable typeface and size, adequate white space between lines
and in the margins, and a pleasing arrangement of the type
masses. The few pages extra that this may involve will be
well worth the cost.

Don't forget to include a title page, showing the book title,
the author or compiler and the publisher or printer, with
the place and year of publication.

By all means try to include as much illustrative material as
possible, particularly if the offset process is to be used in
the production. This includes pictures, drawings, maps, original 
documents (letters, deeds, etc.). These will add to the 
interest and historical value of your publication.

In closing, do not neglect your legal obligations when the
book is published. Section 23a of the Libraries Act 1943—79
spells out the "legal deposit" requirement for all material
published in Queensland. Within one month of the date of
publication you must deliver, at your expense, a copy of the
complete work to the State Librarian, and to the librarian of
the library of the Parliament of Queensland. The Commonwealth
Copyright Act 1968, section 201 requires the same deposit with
the National Library of Australia, Canberra. The NLA publishes
an excellent guide to these provisions in a pamphlet “Legal
Deposit in Australia", which is freely available from that
source. Failure to comply could involve you in a fine not
exceeding $10. plus the cost of the book. Yourwould not want 
to invite a reception of that kind as a reward for such 
devoted and persistent labours as those which will attach to
the writing of your church history.

This act also provides that copyright will automatically
extend to the book from the moment of writing.

It is also worthwhile sending a copy of the work to the
denominational headquarters, the Historical Society, the
Theological College Library, the Historical Society of Queensland,
Queensland University Library, and other similar places 
(including the local Municipal Library).
