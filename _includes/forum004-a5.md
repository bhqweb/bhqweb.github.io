Have you seen the Queensland Baptist lately? Almost each month
recently there has appeared a short paragraph headed, 'A voice from
the past.“ lt features a few paragraphs taken from the pages of the
QB's predecessor ”The Queensland Freeman' of just 100 years earlier.
Some of the material in that paper makes fascinating reading - whether
it be news of Baptist activity, personal notes or advertising. It is
hoped that the QB editor will continue to be kind enough to make space
available for the series to continue.

The *Freeman' is housed in the Baptist Union archives, but
owing to the fragile state of the volumes, it is not generally
accessible for public use, but now that it has been microfilmed by the
John Oxley Library, it will be more readily available
