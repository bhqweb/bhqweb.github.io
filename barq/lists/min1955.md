Names of ministers in the officially published lists of the Baptist Union of Queensland from 1907 to 1955. The dates indicate the **first and last years** in which their names appeared in these lists and **not necessarily the years of their pastorates**. These figures do not allow for periods within the time frame when ministers were not listed because of absence from the pastorate due to leave, serving in another state or other reason. Â© 1999
